<div class="subsection_title">Supply and Demand: Definitions</div>
We introduce the foundational concepts of classical economics: supply and demand. Even though these definitions have much similarities with how they are used in colloquial English language, there are subtle differences and difficulties in formalizing their definitions. Therefore, we will consider the following definitions quite loosely: 
<ul>
  <li>The <b>demand</b> of a good $G$ is known as how much consumers are willing to buy that good $G$, represented as the total amount of units that consumers willing to buy. It is a sign of how needed or wanted that good is. e.g. consumers are willing to buy 1 billion toothbrushes in America. </li>
  <li>The <b>supply</b> of a good $G$ is known as how much producers are willing to sell that good $G$, represented as the total amount of units that producers are willing (to make and) to sell. It is a sign of how much of the good is available. e.g. producers are willing to sell 100,000 tables per year in the state of California. </li>
</ul>

<div class="subsection_title">Marginal Value & Marginal Cost Curves</div>
Before we go any further, observe some basic facts. Whenever a consumer buys a good $G$ for price $P$, by rationality they are buying it because they believe that the value they gain by obtaining a unit of $G$ is greater than that of the price $P$. This is indeed the case since, by the <b>law of diminishing returns</b>, for each successive unit of $G$ the marginal value of one additional unit of $G$ decreases, until there is a point where buying another unit is not worth paying $P$. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Marginal_Value.jpg" width="600px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Additionally, when a supplier sells a good $G$ for price $P$, by rationality they are selling it because they believe that the value they gain by producing and selling a unit of $G$ is greater than that of the price $P$. For some reason I can't find a deeper reason for this than the qualitative description: a higher price will induce producers to supply a higher quantity to the market to maximize profits. I'm sure there is some reason concerning the marginal supply curve, but I have yet to figure this out for some time. 
  <img>


<div class="subsection_title">Supply Curves & Demand Curves</div>
To formalize these concepts mathematically, we now introduce the demand and supply functions, with a simple property for each. The <b>demand function</b> $D_G$ of a certain good $G$ maps a certain price $P$ representing the price that consumers will buy a unit of $G$, and outputs the <b>demand</b> of $G$ in a quantity of $Q$ units. 
  \[D: P \longrightarrow Q\]
Due to the <b>law of demand</b>, this demand function is monotonically decreasing, i.e. the demand is inversely proportional to the price. We can roughly see why because an increase in the price that consumers will buy a unit of $G$ will cause them to buy less, due to an overall smaller marginal value. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Demand_Curve.jpg" width="700px" style="max-width: 90%;">
The <b>supply function</b> $S_G$ of a certain good $G$ maps a certain price $P$ representing the price that producers will sell a unit of $G$, and outputs the <b>supply</b> of $G$ in a quantity of $Q$ units.
  \[S: P \longrightarrow Q\]
Due to the <b>law of supply</b>, this supply function is monotonically increasing, i.e. the supply is directly proportional to the price. We can roughly see why because an increase in the price that producers will sell a unit of $G$ will cause them to sell more, due to an overall greater profit margin. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Curve.jpg" width="700px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Note that this notation for the domains and codomains of both $D$ and $S$ may be misinterpreted to represent the same quantity, but this is not the case. The domain $P$ of $D$ is the price in which the consumers buy, while the domain $P$ of $S$ is the price in which the suppliers sell. The codomain $Q$ of $D$ is the quantity demanded, while the codomain $Q$ of $S$ is the quantity supplied. 

<div class="subsection_title">Supply & Demand Curves Together and Equilibrium</div>
In a market, we have both the sellers and the buyers, so it would make sense to put both curves in the same graph. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_and_Demand.jpg" width="650px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Now using both the <b>laws of supply and demand</b>, let us describe how market forces will act on the trading of goods. 
<ul>
  <li>Assume that the price of good $G$ is $p_- &lt; p$. Then, there will be a deficit of $G$. Consumers will compete to buy these, which will put upwards pressure on the price. </li>
  <li>Assume that the price of good $G$ is $p_+ &gt; p$. Then, there will be a surplus of $G$. Producers will optimize their prices to sell, which wil put downwards pressure on the price. </li>
</ul>
These <b>movements in the supply and demand curve</b> leads to the price and quantity demanded/supplied converging onto an equilibrium point, labeled with $p^*$ and $q^*$, respectively. 

<div class="subsection_title">Shifts in Supply and Demand</div>
An <b>increase in demand</b> simply means that consumers are willing to pay more for the same quantity of a good $G$ (note that this is equivalent to saying that consumers are willing to buy less of $G$ for the same price). This results in an up-rightward shift in the demand curve. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Increase_in_Demand.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;">
A change in demand describes the case when the consumers of a given good or service alter their means of consumption. Here are some examples of when demand changes (note that this shift in demand is different from a change in<i>quantity</i> demanded): 
<ul>
  <li>A shift in population demographic could require the use for more wheelchairs and canes. </li>
  <li>A product mentioned in a popular Netflix show would increase demand for said product. </li>
</ul>
An <b>increase in supply</b> simply means that producers are willing to sell more at the same price $p$. This results in an up-leftward shift in the supply curve. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Increase_in_Supply.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;">
A change in supply describes the case when the suppliers of a given good or service alter production or output. Here are some examples of when supply changes (note that this shift in supply is different from a change in<i>quantity</i> supplied): 
<ul>
  <li>The price of raw materials can increase, resulting in lower prices. </li>
  <li>War against Russia results in sanctions on oil imports into the U.S., decreasing the supply. </li>
</ul>

<div class="subsection_title">Market in Perfect Equilibrium</div>
Let us construct a market from scratch, and with it the general principles that they follow. Assume that civilization has evolved enough to acquire specialization of labour. Let us have three entities, labeled $E_1, E_2, E_3$ with the following properties: 
<ul>
  <li>Annually, $E_1$ produces $1000$ units of good $G_1$. $E_1$ has an annual requirement of $100$ units of $G_2$ and $0$ units of $G_3$. </li>
  <li>Annually, $E_2$ produces $800$ units of good $G_2$. $E_2$ has an annual requirement of $300$ units of $G_1$ and $400$ units of $G_3$. </li>
  <li>Annually, $E_3$ produces $900$ units of good $G_3$. $E_3$ has an annual requirement of $200$ units of $G_1$ and $500$ units of $G_2$. </li>
</ul>
Through <b>trade</b>, these entities can take advantage of their <b>comparative advantages</b> for greater efficiency. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Initial_Trade.jpg" width="500px;" style="max-width: 90%;">
If we look at the market supply and market demand curves for each of the three goods in this 3-entity economy, we will see:
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Demand_Curves_of_3_Goods.jpg" width="800px;" style="max-width: 90%;">
Note that these are <b>market curves</b> which represents the sum of all the supplies and demands of the individuals within a market. In other words, the <b>demand of good $G_1$ (of a market)</b> is the sum of the demands of all buyers in the market. The <b>supply of good $G_1$ (in a market)</b> is the sum of the supplies of all sellers in the market. But this concept of the market curve is too abstract. What does it actually mean to talk about the supply and demand of a good within a market? Let's consider a bigger market with $n$ entities, $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_n$, and just one good $G_1$. Now, note that we make a few assumptions: 
<ol>
  <li>All entities $E_i$ have perfect communication with each other. That is, everybody know what everybody else is buying and selling for their respective prices. </li>
  <li>The price at which a unit is <i>sold</i> is the same for all suppliers. If two entities $E_1$ and $E_2$ sold a unit of good $G$ at different prices, by assumption $1$ all possible consumers would go to whoever is selling at the lower price, pressuring the other to lower its price to match. </li>
  <li>The price at which a unit is <i>bought</i> is the same for all consumers. If two entities $E_1$ and $E_2$ want to buy a unit of good $G$ at different prices, by assumption 1 all possible suppliers would go to whoever is buying at the higher price, pressuring the other to raise its bid to match. </li>
</ol>
Now, good $G$, assuming it is liquid and on a large scale, is circulating countless times among entities as $E_i$ sells to $E_j$. But a <b>transaction</b> can only happen from $E_i$ to $E_j$ if it meets two conditions: 
<ol>
  <li>$E_j$ is willing to buy $G$: that is, the <b>marginal value</b> of an additional unit of $G_1$ is greater than the price. </li>
  <li>$E_i$ is willing to sell $G$: that is, the <b>marginal cost</b> of an additional unit of $G_1$ is less than the price. </li>
</ol>
These two assumptions can be nicely summarized as
\[\text{Marginal Cost of Producing } &lt; \text{ Price of Selling } = \text{ Price of Buying } &lt; \text{ Marginal Value of Buying} \]
If this happens, we can assume that $E_i$ and $E_j$ will automatically trade. Therefore, we can see that:  
<ol>
  <li>The (market) supply of $G_1$ is $1000$ units, since that is how much all the producers (just $E_1$ in this case) are willing to produce until its marginal costs of producing is greater than the price at which they sell. More specifically, since $E_1$ also consmues $300$ units, the supply in the <b>exchange market</b> between the three entities is $700$ units of $G_1$. </li>
  <li>The (market) demand of $G_1$ is also $1000$ units, since that is how much all the consumers ($E_1, E_2, E_3$) are willing to produce until its marginal value of buying is less than the price at which they buy. More specificaly, since $E_1$ also consumes $300$ units, the demand in the exchange market between the three entities is also $700$ units of $G_1$. </li>
</ol>

<div class="subsection_title">Fluctuations in Market Supply and Its Effects</div>
If production is consistent, all is well and everyone lives happily ever after in this state of equilibrium. But with the actual fluctations that occurs in the real world (affected by climate, labor, war, disease, etc.), without loss of generality, $E_1$ may either underproduce or overproduce its optimal amount of $1000$ units of $G_1$. 

We will first introduce a <i>wrong</i> interpretation that I have fallen for many times. The following below is a naive way of interpreting situations when there are fluctuations in supply and demand, which ignores all the concepts that was introduced previously. 
<ul>
  <li>When $E_1$ produces $1200$ units of $G_1$ and uses $300$ units, then there are now $900$ units of $G_1$ that is left for sale in the market, so the market supply is $900$ units. The demand is still $700$ since the needs of entities $E_2$ and $E_3$ haven't changed. Therefore, this surplus of $200$ units is wasted and not bought because $E_2$ and $E_3$ do not need it anymore. It is as good as dead. </li>
  <li>When $E_1$ produces $800$ units of $G_1$ and uses $300$ units, then there are now $500$ units of $G_1$ that is left for sale in the market, so the market supply is $500$ units. The demand is still $700$ since the needs of entities $E_2$ and $E_3$ haven't changed. This shortage of $200$ units will cause distress, but nothing can be done about it within this economy. </li>
</ul>
These cases represents a <i>change in supply</i>. Note that this does <i>not</i> mean a change in quantity supplied, since quantity supplied would be caused by a change in price (remember, $S$ maps price to quantities). Remember our laws that a change in supply will have an efffect on the price (upwards or downwards pressure). 
<ul>
  <li>If the supply of good $G_1$ changes from $1000$ units to $1200$ units, then the supply curve will increase, causing the equilibrium price to fall to $0.8$ dollars at point $eq_2$ and the quantity demanded to increase. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Inc.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;">
  Note that since supply is a continuous process this change should happen continuously, but if for some reason this change in supply happens extremely fast, or if there is a restriction on the price to be 1 dollar, then the price/quantity supplied data will be at point $k$. In this moment, with the price fixed at $1$ dollar, the quantity demanded would naturally be $1000$, while the actual supply would be $1200$, leading to a surplus of $200$. Eventually, the price will drop down from $k$ to the equilibrium point $eq_2$. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Inc_2.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;"></li>
  <li>If the supply of good $G_1$ changes from $1000$ units to $800$ units, then the supply curve will decrease, causing the equilibrium price to rise to $1.2$ dollars at the point $eq_2$ and the quantity demanded to decrease. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Dec.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;"> 
  Again, this should happen continuously, but if for some reason this change in supply happens extremely fast, or if there is a restriction on the price to be 1 dollar, then the price/quantity supplied data will be at $k$. In this moment, with the price fixed at 1 dollar, the quantity demanded would be $1000$ while the actual supply would be $800$, leading to a surplus of $200$. Eventually, the price will rise from $k$ to the equilibrium point at $eq_2$.  
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Supply_Dec_2.jpg" width="300px" style="max-width: 90%;"> 
  </li>
</ul>
Technically, I guess it is possible to model with sufficient accuracy the smooth change in the supply as a bunch of infinitesimal changes that I have described happening in a row. This is what Adam Smith refers to as the <b>invisible hand</b>. 
<br>
Finally, note that in this context (and in most contexts), the supply of a good really means <i>the supply of a good that is available to trade within the market</i>. Goods that are not in some market do not go by these laws of supply and demand. Examples include 
<ul>
  <li>National oil reserves, which are not bought or sold and therefore do not contribute to the supply of an entity (in this case, a nation). </li>
  <li>Privately held stocks (RSU), which do not circulate in the market since they are held for long periods of time and are not sold. </li>
</ul>

<div class="subsection_title">Elasticities</div>
In general, <b>elasticity</b> refers to the rate at which a value is affected by a change in another value. It is a mathematical way of describing how the supply and demand curves are "shaped" (i.e. are they steep? flat? curved? etc.). There are two types of elasticities: 
<ol>
  <li>The <b>price-elasticity of demand</b> refers to how sensitive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. 
  <ul>
    <li>If a price change of $G$ leads to a greater change in quantity demanded, then $G$ is said to be elastic (demand curve becomes flatter). A perfectly elastic demand curve is flat. </li>
    <li>If a price change of $G$ leads to a smaller change in quantity demanded, then $G$ is said to be inelastic (demand curve becomes steeper). A perfectly inelastic demand curve is vertical. </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The <b>price-elasticity of supply</b> refers to how sensitive the quantity supplied is to a change in price. 
  <ul>
    <li>If a price change of $G$ leads to a greater change in quantity supplied, then $G$ is said to be elastic (supply curve becomes flatter). A perfectly elastic supply curve is flat.  </li>
    <li>If a price change of $G$ leads to a smaller change in quantity supplied, then $G$ is said to be inelastic (supply curve becomes steeper). A perfectly inelastic supply curve is vertical. </li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>
There is a precise mathematical formulation for elasticity, but we will not go over them here. Just note a few examples: 
<ol>
  <li>The elasticity of demand of insulin shots is low, since it is a necessary product, a consumer staple. A change in price will not cause consumers who need them to stop buying them. </li>
  <li>The elasticity of demand of computers is high, since it is not a necessary product; it is a discretionary product. A change in price will cause many consumers to stop buying them. </li>
  <li>The elasticity of supply of coffee is high, since a rise in price will cause suppliers to produce more of them. </li>
  <li>The elasticity of supply of grapes is low, since harvest is once a year, so a rise or fall in price will not change much of how they are produced. </li>
</ol>

<div class="subsection_title">Primary vs Secondary Markets</div> 
A distinction that should be know is between primary markets and secondary markets: 
<ul>
  <li>The <b>primary market</b> is where securities or commodities are bought from an issuing body. </li>
  <li>The <b>secondary market</b> is where securities and commodities trade between consumers. </li>
</ul>
The primary market usually is controlled by some powerful entity that oversees the issuance of securities. The secondary market has more regulations and oversights. 
</div>


<p id="Section2" class="section_title">Bond Market</p> 
<a id="show_hide_2" class="show_hide" onclick="show_hide_2()">[Hide]</a>
<hr>
<div id="section_content_2">
Suppose that entity $E_1$, the <b>debtor</b>, wants to borrow 1000 dollars from entity $E_2$, the <b>creditor</b>. There are a couple things we have to think about here: 
<ul>
  <li>If $E_2$ lends $E_1$ the money, then how likely is it that $E_1$ will pay it back? This likelihood is referred to as $E_1$'s <b>creditworthiness</b>. </li>
  <li>Since there is always a nonzero chance that $E_1$ will <b>default</b> (fail to pay back) on the debt, it doesn't make sense to expect the 1000 dollars back; then there is no point in lending out the money at all. $E_2$ must get <i>more</i> than 1000 dollars as a reward for taking on the risk in addition to lending. This leads to the concept of an <b>interest rate</b>. </li>
</ul>
It is easy pretty easy to see where this goes, so I will stop here for the motivation behind some qualities of debts. Bonds are really just a glorified version of debt, and so anybody can issue them. But we don't talk about "bonds" when mentioning a small debt between individuals. The entities who issue bonds are almost always federal governments, state minicipalities, or corporations. 

<div class="subsection_title">Components of Bonds</div>
When the U.S. government issues bonds, investors buy them (the role of selling bonds have been explained in monetary policy). The investors lend bond issuers money, and in return, bond issuers agree to pay investors interest on bonds through the life of the bond and to repay the face value of bonds upon maturity. 
<br>
Say that you lend the U.S. government 1000 dollars and they agree to pay you back in 10 years. Then you receive a 10-year bond worth 1000 dollars, with say, a 5% interest rate. The major components of the bond are listed: 
<ol>
  <li>The <b>face value</b> of the bond is $\$1000$.</li>
  <li>The <b>coupon rate</b> is the $5\%$ rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond. </li>
  <li>The <b>interest payments</b>, <i>which are fixed</i>, are the payments that the bondholder will receive every year, calculated as 
    \[\text{Face Value } \times \text{ Coupon Rate } = \text{ Interest Payments} \]
  The interest payment for this bond is $5\% \times \$1000 = \$50$ every year. 
  </li>
</ol>
With basic arithmetic, we can see that holding this bond allows us to get $\$50$ every year for 10 years, plus our initial loan of $\$1000$ back. For a total of 
  \[\$50 \times 10 + \$1000 = \$1500\]
Therefore, given that we have invested $\$1000$, we have gotten an extra $\$500$. This description of the returns you received on the bond is one of the many ways we can express <b>bond yield</b>. Fundamentally, these different measures of bond yield refers to the expected earnings generated and realized on a bond, expressed as a percentage. Note that the delay in which we recieve the money will cut down the purchasing power of the $\$1500$; we will elaborate on this later. 

<div class="subsection_title">Bond Pricing: Interest Rates and Inflation</div>
Now, we can integrate our knowledge of markets with that of bonds. Let there be entities $E_1, \ldots, E_n$ each owning some arbitrary number of bonds from the federal government, labeled $Fed$. As in all markets, the equilibrium price of certain bonds are determined by shift in supply and demand of the bond. 
<br>
Interest rates (the fed funds rate) heavily influence the demand, and therefore the price, of a bond. Recall that the fed funds rates acts as pretty much a "baseline interest rate" for all kinds of debt obligations throughout the nation. Since the option to lend money to the U.S. government (with a pretty much guarantee in payment back) is always available, banks would charge at lower interests to borrow from each other. This effective fed funds rate that banks use when borrowing is now the "minimum" interest rate that they will charge to consumers when lending (since to get profits their interest on lending must be greater than their interest on borrowing). 
<br>
To be updated: Describe the process of how the fed funds rate affects the coupon rates in newly issued bonds. 
<br>
Let's focus on entities $E_1$ and $E_2$, and say that they each invested $\$10,000$ into $Fed$ to buy $10$ $\$1,000$ 10-year bonds with an annual coupon rate of $10\%$. Therefore, they will receive a fixed-income of $\$100 \times 10 = \$1,000$ per year for the next 10 years. Now, say that the Fed issues $10$ new 10-year $\$1,000$ bonds (with same maturity date). A good thing to keep in mind is that whenever the Fed issues some new bonds, <i>these new bonds determine the standards for how much fixed-income securities are worth</i>. 
<ol>
  <li>If these bonds have a $20\%$ interest rate, this translates to fixed payments of $\$200$ per year. Remember, these are the new standards for bonds now: <i>Any 10-year fixed-income security that pumps out $\$200$/year is worth $\$1,000$</i>, according to the Fed. Therefore, with this standard, any 10-year fixed-income security that pumps out $\$100$/year must be worth twice as little: $\$500$. Therefore, this new standard will cause the demand for $\$100$ fixed-income securities to drop to $\$500$. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Bond_Demand_Decrease.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 90%;"></li>
  <li>If these bonds have a $5\%$ interest rate, this translates to fixed payments of $\$50$ per year. So, the new standard for bond is: <i>Any 10-year fixed-income security that pumps out $\$50$ a year is worth $\$1,000$</i>. Therefore, with this standard, any 10-year fixed-income security that pumps out $\$100$/year must be worth twice as much: $\$2,000$. Therefore, this new standard will cause the demand for $\$100$ fixed-income securities to rise to $\$2,000$. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Bond_Demand_Increase.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 90%;"></li>
</ol>
The adept reader may notice that the bond market behaves in a such a way that the current interest rates of each bond of the same type (i.e. same issuer and same maturity time: 10-year T-bond) throughout the market equal out. 
<ol>
  <li>In the first scenario, the market balances out such that buying a 10-year fixed-income security generating $\$100$/year for $\$500$ is the same as buying a 10-year fixed-income security generating $\$200$/year for $\$1,000$. </li>
  <li>In the second, the market balances out such that buying a 10-year fixed-income security generating $\$50$/year for $\$1000$ is the same as buying a 10-year fixed-income security generating $\$100$/year for $\$2,000$. </li>
</ol>
Another major influence on bonds (and really any fixed-income instrument) is <b>inflation</b>. Some securities may rise in value along with inflation, and therefore are protected, but bonds have none of this. Therefore, if we expect inflation rates to rise in the next few years, then this will decrease the value and therefore the price of bonds. 


<div class="subsection_title">Bond Valuation: Present Value of Future Cash Flows (DCF)</div>
When we are valuing a bond, we are basically trying to answer the question: <i>How much would an investor to pay to purchase a bond (of certain type) today?</i> We can use <b>discounted cash flow (DCF)</b> analysis for this. To compute this bond value (and the values of most other financial assets), we just have to find out the present value of the future income stream discounted at the <b>required rate of return</b>. Let us have a bond with 
<ul>
  <li>face value of $F$, </li>
  <li>coupon rate that determines the annual interest payments to be $C$, </li>
  <li>$N$ years until maturity. Note that we can value bonds that have already given out coupon payments. For example, a 10-year bond that has been issued two years ago will have 8 more coupon payments, but we can interpret this as a 8-year bond with a fixed cash flow with the standard of a current dollar. </li>
  <li>a required rate of return of $r$, which is the market interest rate; that is, the interest rate of bonds within the market. In other words, we are assuming that the Fed will consistently issue bonds with interest rate $r$ for the duration until maturity. The option to invest in bonds with interest $r$ is always available to us. </li>
</ul>
Then, the formula for the <b>present value</b> of the bond is 
\begin{align*} 
  P & = \bigg( \frac{C}{1 + r} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \ldots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^N} \bigg) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^N} \\
  & = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} \bigg) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^N}
\end{align*}
To explain this, note the basic fact that a dollar today is worth <i>more</i> than a dollar in the future because we always have the opportunity to invest it. THat is, a cash flow today is more valuable than an identical cash flow in the future because a present flow can be invested immediately and begin earning returns, while a future flow cannot. Therefore, if we receive $C$ dollars in the future, it is the same as if we had received $C_0 = C (1 + r)^{-1}$ dollars today at prevailing interest rates $r$ since by investing this at this interest rate gives us 
  \[C_0 (1+r) = C\]
dollars in the future. A very closely related term is the <b>net present value (NPV)</b>, which is present value but now takes into account the initial investment costs at year $0$. That is, NPV is detrermined by calculating the costs (negative cash flows) and benefits (positive cash flows) for each period of an investment. Therefore, with a slight modification of the original formula gives
\begin{align*} 
  NPV & = -(\text{Initial Investment}) + \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} \bigg) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^N} \\
  & = \sum_{i=0}^N \frac{\text{Year i Total Cash Flow}}{(1 + r)^i}
\end{align*}
Note that the initial investment (negative value) is included in Year $0$ total cash flow, and the year $N$ total cash flow contains both the coupon payment and the redemption of the face value. 
<br>
For example, suppose that you are an investor who wants to purchase a bond, which is redeemable in 10 years for its face value of $\$1,000$ and pays an annual coupon of $5\%$ on the face value (interest payments of $\$50$ per year)? For multiple prevailing interest rates $r$, we can calculate the present value and the net present value of these investments. Remember, that these rates $r$ represent the absolute guaranteed return on investments, so investing in a fixed-income security with interest rates less than $r$ counts as a <i>loss</i> (in present value). 
<ol>
  <li>If $r = 3\%$, then the value of the bond is 
    \[P = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.03)^i} \bigg) + \frac{1000}{(1.03)^{10}} = \$1170.60 \implies NPV = \$170.60\]
  We would get a profit from this investment because prevailing rates (i.e. guaranteed rate of return) are much lower than the rate of our investment. 
  </li>
  <li>If $r = 4\%$, then the value of the bond is 
    \[P = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.04)^i} \bigg) + \frac{1000}{(1.04)^{10}} = \$1081.11 \implies NPV = \$81.11\]
  We would get a profit from this investment because prevailing rates are lower than the rate of our investment. 
  </li>
  <li>If $r = 5\%$, then the value of the bond is 
    \[P = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.05)^i} \bigg) + \frac{1000}{(1.05)^{10}} = \$1000 \implies NPV = \$0\]
  We would get nothing from this investment because prevailing rates are equal to the rate of our investment. 
  </li>
  <li>If $r = 6\%$, then the value of the bond is 
    \[P = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.06)^i} \bigg) + \frac{1000}{(1.06)^{10}} = \$926.40 \implies NPV = -\$75.60\]
  We would lose money from this investment because prevailing rates are higher than the rate of our investment. 
  </li>
  <li>If $r = 7\%$, then the value of the bond is 
    \[P = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.07)^i} \bigg) + \frac{1000}{(1.07)^{10}} = \$859.53 \implies NPV = -\$140.47\]
  We would lose money from this investment because prevailing rates are much higher than the rate of our investment. 
  </li>
</ol>
These prevailing interest rate would change as a direct result of the fed funds rate. Note that actual prices of these bonds may fluctuate based on other factors, such as creditworthiness, inflation, foreign exchange, etc. 

<div class="subsection_title">Bond Yield: Current Yield & Yield to Maturity (YTM)</div>
If the current price of a bond is given, together with details of coupon and redemption date, then this information can be used to compute the <b>current yield</b>, which is the percentage return based on the price you have bought it: 
  \[\text{Current Yield } = \frac{\text{Interest Payment}}{\text{Price}}\]
However, this valuation is limited in multiple ways. First, they don't measure the value of reinvested interest. The <b>internal rate of return (IRR)</b>, or the <b>yield to maturity (YTM)</b>, of an investment in a bond takes this into account (the IRR is a more general term covering other investments, so we will use YTM in this context). Given a bond that is redeemable in $N$ years producing a fixed-income of $C$ (which is the coupon rate time the face value $F$), priced at $P$, the YTM is the value of $r$ satisfying the following equation 
\begin{align*} 
  P & = \frac{C}{(1+r)} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \ldots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^{N}} + \frac{F}{(1+r)^N} \\
  & = \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} \bigg) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^N} 
\end{align*}
What does this YTM actually mean? The IRR (and YTM) of an investment is the rate of return that sets the net present value of all cash flows (both positive and negative) equal to $0$. More colloquially, the YTM tells us what the prevailing interest rate would have to be such that our investment is worth exactly $0$. This process is actually the inverse of what we did last subsection: 
<ul>
  <li>Previously, we look at the given prevailing interest rates $r$ and compute the value/expected price of a bond. </li>
  <li>Here, we look at the price of a bond and determine what prevailing interest rates $r$ would there need to be for us to profit, break even, or lose on this investment. </li>
</ul>
If we expect interest rates on bonds to be higher than the YTM in the future, then we would expect to lose money from this investment if we buy it at a price of $P$. Analogously, if we expect interest rates on bonds to be lower than the YTM, then we would expect to gain money from this investment if we buy it at a price of $P$. 
<br>
Quick refresher on <b>annualized returns</b>. If we make an investment of $C$ dollars and get a profit of $P$ dollars after $N$ years, then we can say that we got a total return of $P/C - 1$, represented as a percentage. But if we would like to represent it as a compounded annual return, we can calculate the annualized return of this investment: 
  \[\sqrt[N]{\frac{P}{C}} - 1\]
Now we can introduce an extremely useful property of the YTM of a bond: <i>The YTM represents the annualized rate of return of a bond, given that all coupons are reinvested at a yield equal to the YTM, and that the bond is held to maturity. </i>  
<br>
Suppose we have a bond with face value of $\$100$ and coupon rate of $7\%$, implying coupon payments of $\$7$/year, and the bond is reedemable in 5 years. We see that it has a market price of $\$106.62$. We can compute the YTM by computing the $r$ in the equation: 
  \[\$106.62 = \frac{7}{(1+r)} + \frac{7}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{7}{(1+r)^3} + \frac{7}{(1+r)^4} + \frac{107}{(1+r)^5}\]
We find that $YTM = 5.46\%$. Calculations are not important here since we do it numerically anyways. Remember that this means that within prevailing interest rates of $5.46\%$, this bond would be worth exactly $\$0$. Furthermore, we can also claim that the annualized rate of return of this bond, given that all coupons are reinvested at the same yield, after 5 years is $5.46\%$. To see what this means, follow the steps: 
<ol>
  <li>In year 0, we have invested $\$106.62$. </li>
  <li>In year 1, we receive a coupon payment of $\$7$, which we invest immediately at the rate of $5.46\%$. Over the next 4 years until the bond matures, the $\$7$ compounds to $\$8.66$. </li>
  <li>In year 2, we receive a coupon payment of $\$7$, which we invest immediately at the rate of $5.46\%$. Over the next 3 years until the bond matures, the $\$7$ compounds to $\$8.21$. </li>
  <li>In year 3, we receive a coupon payment of $\$7$, which we invest immediately at the rate of $5.46\%$. Over the next 2 years until the bond matures, the $\$7$ compounds to $\$7.79$. </li>
  <li>In year 4, we receive a coupon payment of $\$7$, which we invest immediately at the rate of $5.46\%$. Over the next 1 year until the bond matures, the $\$7$ compounds to $\$7.38$. </li>
  <li>In year 5, we receive a coupon payment of $\$7$ and the face value of $\$100$. The bond matures. </li>
</ol>
Therefore, after 5 years we have 
  \[\$8.66+\$8.21 + \$7.79 + \$7.38 + \$107 = \$139.04\]
and so our initial investment of $\$106.62$ increased to $\$139.04$, a total return of $30.47\%$. Annualized over 5 years, this is equivalent to an annual return of $5.46\%$ (same as the YTM as we have said), and so rather than treating the bond as a fixed-income instrument, we can interpret it as an investment that compounds. 


<div class="subsection_title">Primary Issuance: Treasury Bill Auctions</div>
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are issued through an electronic bill Dutch auction. A <b>Dutch auction</b> is an auction in which the price of something offered is determined after taking in all bids to arrive at the highest price at which the total offering can be can be sold. The bond auction is open to the public, both institutional and individual investors. 24 <b>primary dealers</b> (financial institutions and brokerages) are required to participate. It is divided into competitive and noncompetitive bids. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Competitive bids</b> are bids where the buyer specifies the rate that they will accept. It is mainly submitted by institutional investors, and competitive bidding is limited to $35\%$ of the offering amount for each bidder. </li>
  <li><b>Noncompetitive bidding</b> are bids where the buyer agrees to accept the rate determined at the auction (same rate as that determined by competitive bids). It is submitted often by individuals, and noncompetitive bidding is limited to $\$5$ million per auction. </li>
</ul>
<br>
It is best to explain through an example: Suppose the Treasury seeks to raise $\$9$ million in two-year notes with a $5\%$ coupon. Entities can bid up to 30 days in advance of the auction, and let us assume that the submitted bids are as follows: 
<ul>
  <li>$\$1$ million at $4.79\%$</li>
  <li>$\$2.5$ million at $4.85\%$</li>
  <li>$\$2$ million at $4.96\%$</li>
  <li>$\$1.5$ million at $5\%$</li>
  <li>$\$3$ million at $5.07\%$</li>
  <li>$\$1$ million at $5.1\%$</li>
  <li>$\$5$ million at $5.5\%$</li>
</ul>
The bids with the lowest yield will be accepted first since the issuer will prefer to pay lower yields to its bond investors. In this case, since the Treasury is looking to raise $\$9$ million, it will accept the bidns with the lowest yield up to $5.07\%$. At this mark, only $\$2$ million of the $\$3$ million bid will be approved. All bids above the $5.07\%$ yield will be rejected, and bids below will be accepted. This auction is cleared at $5.07\%$, and all successful bidders receie the $5.07\%$ yield. 
<br>

<div class="subsection_title">Types of Bonds & Creditworthiness of Issuers</div>
We can categorize bonds by the entities that issue them. The type of entity also determine the general level of creditworthiness of the issuers: the government is deemed to be very creditworthy, while corporations are riskier. 
<ol>
  <li><b>Corporate bonds</b> are issued by companies. Companies issue bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing in many cases because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates. </li>
  <li><b>Municipal bonds</b> are issued by states and municipalities (local governments). </li>
  <li><b>Government bonds</b>, or <b>treasury bonds</b>, are issued by the U.S. Treasury. </li>
  <li><b>Agency bonds</b> are those issued by government-affiliated organizations (e.g. Fannie Mae). </li>
</ol>
Other types of bonds are listed briefly, but except for zero-coupon bonds, we rarely see any of these other types. 
<ol>
  <li><b>Zero-coupon bonds</b> do not pay coupon payments are instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures (e.g. U.S. Treasury bills). </li>
  <li><b>Convertible bonds</b> are bonds that gives the bondholder the option to convert their debt into stock at some point, depending on conditions. </li>
  <li><b>Reverse convertible bonds</b> are bonds that now give the <i>issuer</i> the option to convert. </li>
  <li><b>Callable bonds</b> is one that can be called back by the company before it matures, for instance when interest rates become too disadvantageous for the issuers. </li>
  <li><b>Puttable bonds</b> allow the bondholders to put (or sell) the bond back to the company before maturity. </li>
</ol>

<div id="section_content_3">
<b>Stocks</b> are a type of security that represents a share in the ownership of a corporation. That is, owning a stock is equivalent to owning its relative position in the company and its profits, and possibly voting rights. But what exactly does it mean to "own" a company? To explain this, we can interpret a business to be some sort of entity with input and output cash flows. 
<ul>
  <li>The majority of the cash flows flowing into the business is the revenue earned from the goods and services that the business provides. </li>
  <li>The majority of the cash flows flowing out of the business are the costs, such as COGS, employment compensation & benefits, operations, lawsuits, taxes, interest on debts, etc.</li>
</ul>
Ideally, the company will have a net profit, or a net positive cash flow, which means that the cash flows in is greater than the cash flows out. All this profit, i.e. this extra money, now goes to the owners of this business through <b>dividends</b>. Note that it is <i>not</i> the case that the profits go to the CEO. The CEO is a glorified version of an employee, but still in the end an employee, with an income just like every other employee, albeit a very high one. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Business_Cash_Flow.jpg" width="600px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Obviously, the owner has a bigger role to play rather than collect profits. They must also decide on things. But since there are usually many owners, these decisions are made through votes in meetings like the <b>annual shareholder meeting</b>. 

<div class="subsection_title">Classification of Stocks</div>
The ownership of a stock really possible rights to earn dividends and possible rights to vote. There is a much greater variety of stocks, but we will go through common ones. 
<ol>
  <li><b>Common stocks</b> are the most common type of stock. Common stock shareholders receive dividends in proportion to the amount of profit generated each year, and they have voting rights. They are usually the lowest priority over a company's income, after the creditors and preferred stock shareholders. </li>
  <li><b>Preferred stock</b> are much less common and liquid. Preferred stock shareholders receive fixed dividends and no voting rights. They receive payments after bondholders but before common shareholders. </li>
</ol>
Stocks may also have the following characteristics below. Generally, we work with common and preferred stocks, but other ones may be labeled using letters (e.g. Class A, Class B stocks) that have certain qualities mentioned below. 
<ul>
  <li>Voting Power. <b>Nonvoting shares</b> have no voting power while <b>executive shares</b> can be worth 10 votes. </li>
  <li>Payment Priority. <b>Deferred shares</b> are set as a lower priority for dividends and corporate assets. </li>
  <li>Cumulative. <b>Cumulative shares</b> can accumulate dividend payments that have been deferred due to low profits in the past. </li>
  <li>Convertible. <b>Convertible shares</b> can be converted into different forms of financial assets(e.g. preferred shares may be convertible into common ones, common shares may be convertible into corporate bonds). </li>
</ul>
Note that if an entity (individual or organization) has the majority ownership or a <b>controlling interest</b> (at least $50\%$ in voting rights) of a company, then they have the power to do pretty much whatever they want with the company. 

<div class="subsection_title">Primary Stock Market: Private Funding</div>
A company gets its funding from debt (e.g. bonds) and equity (stocks). If the prospect of paying interest on debts are not suitable, a company may issue stocks to investors. In other words, the company is selling parts of itself in exchange for capital. The number of shares, type of shares, and the prices for these shares is entirely determined by the seller and buyer. For example, a business may need to raise $\$100$ million in capital and can choose to issue 10 million shares at $\$10$ each. 
<br>
For early-stage businesses, these are mainly funded by <b>venture capital firms</b> and <b>angel investors</b> (but is not limited to them) through different rounds roughly ordered: seed round, Series A, Series B, Series C, etc. After due diligence, these venture firms, as early investors, may get extra privileges, such as anti-dilution protection, guaranteed board seats, liquidation preferences, priority dividends. 
<br>
Note that upon multiple rounds of issuance, more and more stocks will circulate through more hands, causing <b>stock dilution</b>. No investor would want this and therefore stocks must be issued carefully. At this point, the ownership of a company is held within the hands of private individuals and firms. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/company_in_private_hands.jpg" width="700px" style="max-width: 90%;">
One final characteristic to note is the <b>nominal value</b>, or <b>par value</b>, of a company's stock. Like the face value of a bond when issued, the nominal value of the stock is its stated value. It is an arbitrary value assigned for balance sheet purposes when the company is issuing share capital, and is typically $\$1$ or less. It has little to no bearing on the stock's market price, so no need to worry about this number. 

<div class="subsection_title">Primary Stock Market: Public Offerings & Underwriting</div>
Perhaps after a few years, the firm has grown to the point where funding on an even larger scale to support even more expansion is needed. Private sources may be too restrictive or small, and so companies may need to tap into the capital of the general public. Thus, they can do a <b>public offering</b>, an issuance of the stock to the general public rather than private entities. This process of an <b>initial public offering (IPO)</b> and the company being listed on a stock exchange is what is referred to as a company "going public." 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Going_public.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Investment banks, through underwriting services, faciliate public offerings. 
  <img src="Markets_Pictures/Investment_bank_underwriting.jpg" width="500px" style="max-width: 90%;">
Throughout the years, companies may do the following: 
<ol>
  <li>Additional <b>stock issuance</b> to both public and private investors. </li>
  <li><b>Stock splits</b> to increase liquidity if the stock price is too high or for other reasons. <b>Reverse stock splits</b> may also be done. </li>
  <li><b>Stock buyback</b> where the company uses its institutional funds to buy back shares from the market to incrase its <b>treasury shares</b>. This may be used for anti-dilution purposes or to retain voting control. We can think of these as the opposite as a stock issuance, since treausry shares do not have dividend rights nor voting rights. </li>
  <li>Issue <b>restricted stock units (RSUs)</b> to employees. The grant is restricted because it is subject to a vesting schedule, which can be based on length of employment or performance goals. </li>
</ol>
With these, we can organize the number of stocks circulating in different levels, from biggest to smallest: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Authorized shares</b> refers to the maximum number of shares that a corporation is legally permitted to issue. Companies don't usually get close to this number due to market conditions, which will be explained later. </li>
  <li><b>Shares issued</b> refers to the total number of shares issued, including all public shares, private shares, and treasury shares. </li>
  <li><b>Outstanding shares</b> refer to a compnay's stock currently held by all shareholders, both public and private shares (including RSUs). It does not include treasury stocks however. </li>
  <li><b>Floating shares</b> are the shares considered available for the general public. Moreoever, the <b>floating percentage</b> represents the portion of outstanding shares that are floating: 
    \[\text{Floating Percentage } = \frac{\text{Floating Shares}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}\]</li>
</ol>
A diagram may simplify the information.

<div class="subsection_title">Brokerages and Market Makers</div>

Trader, Broker, Liquidity provider, Market maker 

NYSE is a stock exchange that leases a space to different market makers (banks, hedge funds). It also makes money thorugh fees from companies to be listed on NYSE. If a crash happens (i.e. a market maker buys a stock and it tanks before they can sell it), then the market makers get screwed. 

<div class="subsection_title">Stock Prices & Market Value</div>
Now, we get to the interesting part. We can construct a market of $n$ entities $E_1, \ldots, E_n$, with each entity having ownership of $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ stocks, where $c_i \geq 0$. Remember at the most fundamental level, owning a stock is like owning the profits and voting power of a part of a company, which we can represent as a giant box that churns out cash. By owning one share, we own a part of that box. In this context, we will observe the dynamics of public markets. 
<br>
We can draw the supply and demand curves for a certain company's stock. We can treat stocks as goods, with the company being the supplier and public investors as the consumers. 
<ul>
  <li>The demand curve says: as the price for a stock, i.e. a piece of the company, increases the quantity demanded by the market (consumers) will decrease because the costs of buying the stock will outweigh the marginal value of the share. There is a very important distinction to make here between stocks and other type of goods. Unlike consumable goods which we can clearly observe a diminishing marginal value (drinking 1 can of soda vs 2 cans vs 3 cans vs...), stocks do not seem to have any diminishing marginal value. That is, if I buy 10 shares, I expect to get precisely 10 times the profit than if I bought just 1 share. The value is not diminishing, so why is the demand curve monotonically decreasing? That is because it is not diminishing <i>for an individual</i>, but if we look at a market of many individuals, they all have different interpretations of what the marginal value of the stock is. Individual $A$ may interpret the marginal value as $\$10$, while $B$ sees it as worth $\$8$, and $C$ sees $\$6$. All three marginal utility curves would be horizontal, but if we take the market utility, we can see that it is decreasing (e.g. at the price of $\$7$, a share is attractive to $C$ but not $A, B$, and at $\$9$, a share is attractive to $B, C$ but not $A$). Buying an infinite number of shares is not realistic, so let us assume that each person has $\$25$ worth to invest. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Stock_demand_curve.jpg" width="800px" style="max-width: 90%;">
  We can clearly see that the sum of these individual horizontal marginal value functions summed up produces a monotonically decreasing marginal value function and a monotonically decreasing demand curve for the total market. 
  </li>
  <li>The supply curve is simpler to interpret, since the only supplier is the issuing company (or whatever underwriting investment banks). By the law of supply, we can interpret that if the worth of the company's shares increases, then it would be logical for the company to issue more shares, all else being the same. This interpretation may be too oversimplistic, since we have to account for investor relations, dilution, and other factors, but it will do for now to justify that the supply curve of a stock is monotonically increasing.  </li>
</ul>
Note that in general, the demand of a company's shares is much more volatile than the supply since there are many ways for the demand to shift, while few for the supply. 
<ol>
  <li>The demand (not quantity demanded) of a company's shares can be changed from news, world events, production, and such, which occurs often and may even violently shift the outlook of the business. </li>
  <li>Unlike certain goods that are produced continuously, a company's floating shares will not change unless there is a new issuance or a private investors sells shares at market price. Therefore, supply (not quantity supplied) does not change easily. </li>
</ol>
Now, let us have the supply and demand curves of a company's share. [From this point on unsure about dynamics of supply/demand curves for stocks] Assume that it is at the equilibrium position, where $p^*_1$ is the current market price (bought and sold) and $q_1^*$ is the quantity demanded and supplied, as balance. 
<ol>
  <li>If the demand increases, then the shift in the demand curve raises the equilibrium price to $p_2^*$, which raises the price of the stock. The quantity demanded/supplied also increases to $q_2^*$, but this desire to increase quantity cannot be met due to other factors. Therefore, we can interpret this case as such: The increase in demand can change the price accordingly, but the increase in desired quantity is offset by other factors (not being able to issue stocks freely). 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Stock_Demand_Increase.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 90%;">
  </li>
  <li>If the supply increases, then this is much simpler to explain. Due to dilution, one stock now represents ownership of a smaller portion of the company, driving the price down. The equilibrium (optimal) quantity demanded and supplied increases due to this higher supply, which is reflected in the reality that there are more more shares issued now. 
    <img src="Markets_Pictures/Stock_Supply_Increase.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 90%;">

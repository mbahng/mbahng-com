<div class="subsection_title">Assets, Debt, and Income of a Business</div>
<div>
Every business's balance sheet can be summarized in terms of the <b>Accounting Equation</b>: 
\[\text{Total Assets } = \text{ Liabilities } + \text{ Equity}\]
<b>Assets</b> represent the resources controlled by the company, and the <b>liabilities</b> represent the debts that it owes to creditors. <b>Equity</b> represents the value that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debts were paid off, also known as the company's <b>net assets</b> or <b>book value</b>. We can also think of equity as representing the shareholders' stake in the company, identified on a company's balance sheet. 
<br><br>
This representation partitions all uses of capital (assets) to the two main sources of capital: debt capital (gotten through lending) and equity capital (gotten through selling shares). For a company keeping accurate accounts, every business transaction will be represented in at least two of its accounts. For instance, if a business takes a loan from a bank, the borrowed money will be reflected in its balance sheet as both an increase in the company's assets and an increase in its loan liability. If a business buys raw materials and pays in cash, it will result in an increase in the company's inventory (an asset) while reducing cash capital (another asset). Because there are two or more accounts affected by every transaction carried out by a company, the accounting system is referred to as <b>double-entry accounting</b>. Here are some of the major components of each part of the balance sheet. Different companies use different terminology, which may be confusing, so we list as many as possible. 
<ol>
  <li>
    Current Assets
    <ol>
      <li><b>Cash & Cash Equivalents</b> are assets that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately. These include bank accounts and marketable securities, which are debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days. Often times, cash equivalents do not include equity or stock holdings because they can fluctuate in value. Other examples include commercial paper, Treasury bills, and short-term government bonds with maturity dates of 3 months or less. <b>Restricted cash</b> is cash set aside for a particular purpose (e.g. purchasing something or repaying a loan). </li>
      <li><b>Marketable Securities</b> can be included as a separate line (e.g. Apple). They are liquid (maturity of less than 1 year) financial securities that can be quickly converted into cash at a reasonable price, and the rates at which they can be bought or sold have little effect on prices. </li>
      <li><b>Inventory</b> refers to the raw materials used in production, the work-in-progress, and the finished goods produced that are available for sale. The <i>turnover of inventory</i> is very important for the company's revenue. </li>
      <li><b>Account/Trade Receivables</b> is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. It typically ranges from a few days to a year. </li>
      <li><b>Non Trade Receivables</b> are also receivables due to firm but for something <i>other</i> than its normal customer services and goods. They are not related directly to the core operating business of the company. Examples include amounts owed to a company by its employees for loans or wage advances, tax refunds, or insurance claims. They are usually classified as a current assets since they are typically paid within one year. 
      <br>
      Apple has <b>vendor non trade receiveables</b>, which are receivables from its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. Apple purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. </li>
      <li><b>Digital assets</b> refer to cryptocurrency and assets that can be stored in a blockchain (e.g. smart contracts, NFTs). </li>
      <li><b>Operating lease vehicles</b> (Tesla) refers to the inventory of vehicles that are to be leased out to customers. "Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation."</li>
      <li><b>Prepaid expenses</b> is an asset that results from a busness making advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future. They are initially recorded as assets, but their value is expensed over time onto the income statement. For example, assume ABC Company purchases insurance for the upcoming 12 month period. It pays USD120,000 upfront for the insurance policy. ABC Company will initially book the full USD120,000 as a debit to prepaid insurance, an asset on the balance sheet, and a credit to cash. Each month, an adjusting entry will be made to expense USD10,000 (1/12 of the prepaid amount) to the income statement through a credit to prepaid insurance and a debit to insurance expense. In the 12th month, the final USD10,000 will be fully expensed and the prepaid account will be zero.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Noncurrent/Fixed Assets
    <ol>
      <li><b>Marketable securities</b> are explained above, but with a maturity date of longer than 1-year. </li>
      <li><b>Property, Plant, and Equipment</b></li>
      <li><b>Nonoperating Assets</b> refer to assets that are not essential to the ongoing operations of a business but may still generate income or provide a return on investment (ROI). This is in contrast to <b>operating assets</b>. </li>
      <li><b>Intangible assets</b> are assets that are not physical in nature, which as <b>goodwill</b>, <b>brand recognition</b>, and <b>intellectual property</b>, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. </li>
      <li>The IFRS16 (2019 lease accounting rule) also stated that when a leasor leases to a lessee, the lessee has to record the leased assets as a <b>right-of-use asset</b>. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Liabilities
    <ol>
      <li><b>Accounts/Salaries Payable</b></li>
      <li><b>Accrued Expenses</b></li>
      <li><b>Current Maturities on Debt Liabilities</b></li>
      <li><b>Mortgages, Bonds</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
Finally, we will use the term <b>working capital</b>, which is really just the <i>current</i> assets minus <i>current</i> liabilities: 
\[\text{Working Capital } = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]
<br>
When talking about income, we will refer to these terms below many times, which should all be self-explanatory: 
<ul>
    <li><b>Operating Expenses (OPEX)</b>: Expenses needed to operate/maintain the business (sometimes synonymous with SG&A). In the broader sense, we can think of it as: COGS + SG&A + R&D + D&A</li>
    <li><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b>: The direct costs associated with producing goods (e.g. direct materials, direct labor, equipment costs, overhead costs for facility).</li>
    <li><b>Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A)</b>: Typically costs associated with a company's overall overhead. It can be thought of as all non-COGS operational expenses. (e.g. accounting, legal, corporate office overhead, advertising, marketing, rent)</li>
    <li><b>Research & Development (R&D)</b>: Reseach & Development (which are tax-deductible) </li>
    <li><b>Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)</b>: The depreciation of CAPEX assets are accounted for in here. </li>
    <li><b>Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)</b>: Purchases that a business makes as an investment (e.g. real estate, factory, computers, furniture, intellectual property, copyrights, patents) to help it generate more revenue. CAPEX purchases are not immediately reported on an income statement. Rather, it is treated as an asset on the balance sheet, that is deducted over the course of several years as a depreciation expense in D&A. Ideally, the increase in revenue made from this CAPEX investment would outweigh the depreciation rate of the investment.  </li>
    <li><b>Revenue</b>:  Total Worth of a company's goods & services sold</li>
    <li><b>Gross Profit</b>: Revenue - COGS </li>
    <li><b>EBITDA</b>: Gross Profit - SG&A - R&D</li>
    <li><b>Operating Income/EBIT</b>: Revenue - OPEX</li>
    <li><b>Net Income</b>: Operating Income - Taxes - Interest Expenses on Debts</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="subsection_title">Ratio Measures</div>
<div>
A quick and easy way to measure the health of a company is by looking at its financial ratios. They compare two quantities of a certain company and are usually good indicators of different states of a business. Note that <b>earnings per share (EPS)</b> refers to the total net income divided by the shares outstanding, representing the amount of earnings one shareholder would have. 
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Working Capital ratio</b> is similar to working capital, but we divide the current assets by the current liabilities to compare the two: 
    \[\text{Working Capital } = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio</b> measures the market cap of the company relative to its total net income. In here, we are comparing the market value of the company with the company's ability to generate money. If the ratio is too high, then this may indicate that the market value is too high relative to the amount of profit the company is making, meaning that the company may be overvalued. 
    \[P/E = \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Net Income}} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{EPS}}\]
    There are actually many different types of P/E ratios, which are all worth mentioning here: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The regular P/E ratio is also called a <b>trailing PE ratio</b> because it is based on the previous periods of earnings, usually the <b>last twelve months (LTM)</b>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Investors often also use the <b><i>forward</i> P/E ratio</b>, which uses the <i>expected</i> future earnings (EPS). This is reasonable since the stock-market is always forward-looking. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Shiller P/E ratio</b> is a trailing ratio but rather than looking at LTM, which may flucuate based on market/seasonal conditions, it looks at the earnings of the past 10-years. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Price to Book (P/B) ratio</b> measures the market cap of the company relative to the book value. Therefore, this is a comparison between the believed and actual value of the business. It is almost always the case where this ratio is above $1.0$, but occasionally it falls below. If it is below $1$, then this means that if the company liquidated all of its assets and sold everything, we would earn more money than we paid for. This is a signal of undervalued companies. However, dim future prospects, poor management, forseeable regulatory measures, etc. could drive this ratio down, also signaling a terrible company to invest in. 
    \[P/B = \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Book Value}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>current ratio</b> measures the <i>current</i> assets to <i>current</i> liabilities of a firm. This essentially measures the firm's liquidity, i.e. whether it has enough resources (current assets) to pay its current liabilities. It calculates how many dollars in current assets are available for each dollar in short-term debt. 
    \[\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>quick ratio</b> is a more conservative view of the current ratio, as it now excludes inventory (which is considered a part of current assets). 
    \[\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets } - \text{ Inventories}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Debt to Equity ratio</b>, also called the <b>acid test</b>, measures the <i>total</i> liabilities relative to the <i>total</i> equity. It measures the ability of the company to use its current assets to retire current liabilities. It provides an indication of how the firm finances its assest. A high ratio indicates that the company is financing a large percentage of its assets with debt, not a good thing. 
    \[\text{D/E } = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Equity}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Return on Equity (ROE)</b> measures profitability and how effectively a company uses shareholder money to make a profit, usually as a percentage %. It compares the amount of profits generated based on the amount of equity lent out for funding. If the net income was okay but the total equity was extremely large, then this means that the company used a lot of equity to generate this okay profit; so the company did <i>not</i> efficiently use shareholder money. 
    \[\text{ROE } = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Equity}}\]
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

Now, we present data on these ratios by sectors. 


  
The U.S. <b>Securities and Exchange Commission</b>, known as the <b>SEC</b>, has been created through the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to help restore investor confidence following the stock market crash of 1929. The SEC is an independent government agency tasked with protecting investors, maintaining a fair and orderly market, and facilitating capital formation. SEC filings are regulatory documents required of all public companies to provide key information to investors and potential investors. 
<br>
The annual and quarterly reports are the most important filings of the SEC since they contain the financial statements of the company (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement). Note that these statements are not unique to public companies; private companies also have these statements, so knowledge about them would help for all types of businesses.

When a company needs more capital, it can get some by creating shares and selling them to the public, a process called <b>public offering</b>. The process for an <b>initial public offering (IPO)</b> and a <b>secondary public offering</b> are similar.

<p class="title">Personal Notes: Philosophy</p>
<p class="intro_text"> The following are the topics I have studied (and will be planning to study) during my time in the Korean military until November 2022. As these notes are primarily for my personal use, I did not spend as much time writing them in a manner that is clear for all readers. But since it would be a waste not to share them, I uploaded them on this website. All of my personal notes are free to download, use, and distrbute under the Creative Commons "Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International" license. Please contact me if you find any errors in my notes or have any further questions. I have used the LaTeX editing program Overleaf to create my notes; diagrams are often drawn using the tikz package or iPad Notes.</p>

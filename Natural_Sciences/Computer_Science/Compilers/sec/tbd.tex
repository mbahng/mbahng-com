\section{Jan 7} 

  Will be working in tiger. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Lexer}. Convert a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. Need to talk about DFA, NFA, and regular expressions.  
    \item \textit{Parsing}. Building the abstract syntax tree. e.g. LL parsing (what we are doing) vs LR parsing. MLyac. Trees make everything explicit and so is easier to work with. 
    \item \textit{Type Checking}. 
    \item \textit{IR}. Top of the mountain. 
    \item \textit{Instruction Selection}. 
    \item \textit{Liveness Analysis}. Data flow analysis, which is at the core of a lot of optimization. 
    \item \textit{Register Allocation}. This gives the MIPS assembly, which is text. 
  \end{enumerate}

  Expression evaluates to a value, while a statement is ...
  SMl-NJ, sort of functional.

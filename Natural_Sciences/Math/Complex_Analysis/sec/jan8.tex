\section{Jan 8} 

  We start off with some useful geometry, which doesn't seem relevant now but will be helpful later on. 

  \begin{definition}[Complex Projective Line]
    Define equivalence relation on $\mathbb{C}^2 \setminus \{ 0\}$ by specifiying $\zeta \sim \xi$ iff $\exists 0 = c \in \mathbb{C}$ s.t. $\xi = c \zeta$. Here, $0 \neq \zeta, \xi \in \mathbb{C}^2$. 

    That is, $\xi \sim \zeta$ means that they span the same 1-dimensional linear subspace. Then, we define the \textbf{complex projective line} as 
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbb{CP}^1 = (\mathbb{C}^2 \setminus \{0\}) / \sim
    \end{equation} 
    The $\mathbb{C}$ stands for complex, but we will omit it since this is about complex analysis. The set of all 1-dimensional linear subspaces is called the \textbf{Grassmanian}, denoted
    \begin{equation}
      \mathrm{Gr}(1, \mathbb{C}^2) 
    \end{equation}
    These spaces are all the same. 
  \end{definition}

  For notation, given $\zeta = (\zeta_0, \zeta_1) \neq 0 \in \mathbb{C}^2$ , we denote $[\zeta] = [\zeta_0 : \zeta_1] \in \mathbb{P}^1$ be the line spanned by $\zeta$. 

  A philosophy of complex geometry is that to study a space, you should study the functions on that space. So we will study \textit{holomorphic functions} on the space. So what are the functions are $\mathbb{P}^1$? We care about holomorphic functions, and the only holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{P}^1$ tend to be complex. 

  Let's let $\mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]$ the ring of complex polynomials in two variables, and let $\mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]_d \subset \mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]$ be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$. 

  Suppose $P \in \mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]$. Then $P$ is homogeneous of degree $d$ iff $P(\lambda \zeta_0, \lambda \zeta_1) = \lambda^d P (\zeta_0, \zeta_1)$ for all $\zeta \in (\zeta_0, \zeta_1) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ and for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. 

  Fix a line $[\zeta] \in \mathbb{P}^1$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$. This line is paramterized by $\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \to \lambda \zeta \in \mathbb{C}^2$. If we restrict $P$ to this line, it takes the values $P(\lambda \zeta) = \lambda^d P (\zeta)$. Therefore, $P$ does \textit{not} define a function on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Intuitively, we can think of this as ``if it vanishes at 1 (nonzero) point on the line, it vanishes at all points on the line.'' But $\{P = 0\} \subset \mathbb{P}^1$ is well-defined, because $P(\zeta) = 0 \implies P(c \zeta) = 0$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C} \implies P(\xi) = 0$ for all $\xi \sim \zeta$. 

  \begin{theorem}
    Suppose $P, Q \in \mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]_d$. We claim the map $F: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ defined by 
    \begin{equation}
      [\zeta] \mapsto [ P(\zeta), Q(\zeta)] 
    \end{equation}
    is well-defined\footnote{Maps of this form are called \textit{rational functions}, which has some connection to what you already might think of as rational functions.} as long as $\{P = 0 \} \cap \{Q = 0\} = \{0\} \subset \mathbb{C}^2$. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $\zeta \neq 0 \in \mathbb{C}^2$, but $P(\zeta), Q(\zeta) = 0$, i.e. is in the $0$-locus of both polynomials. Then $[P(\zeta) : Q(\zeta)] = [0 : 0]$ is not defined. So $\{P = 0\} \cap \{Q = 0\} = \{0\}$ is necessary. 

    To see that $F$ is well-defined, we must show that $F$ takes the same value on $[\zeta]$ and $[c \zeta]$ for all $0 \neq c \in \mathbb{C}$. 
    \begin{align}
      F([c \zeta]) & = [P(c \zeta) : Q(c \zeta)] \\ 
                   & = [ c^d P(\zeta) : c^d Q(\zeta)] \\ 
                   & = [P(\zeta) : Q(\zeta)] = F([\zeta])
    \end{align}
    So the definition of $F$ is independent of the generator of the line, so this is nice. 
  \end{proof}

  \begin{example}
    If $A \in \mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C}$, then 
    \begin{equation}
      [\zeta] \mapsto [A \zeta] 
    \end{equation}
    is a well-defined map $[A] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$. Maps of this form are called Mobius transformations.\footnote{very important since they are very flexible and can be used to normalize problems to make solutions much easier.} Just do the same thing. 
  \end{example}

  We know that $\mathbb{P}^1$ is the 1-point compactification of $\mathbb{C}$. We can write $\mathbb{P}^1 = U_0 \cup U_1$, where 
  \begin{align}
    U_0 & = \{[\zeta_0 : \zeta_1] \in \mathbb{P}^1 \colon \zeta_0 \neq 0 \} \\
    U_1 & = \{[\zeta_0 : \zeta_1] \in \mathbb{P}^1 \colon \zeta_1 \neq 0 \}
  \end{align}
  This is handy, since it gives me a sneaky way to put the complex plane into the projective line. Define map $\mathbb{C} \to U_1$, 
  \begin{equation}
    z \mapsto [z : 1] \in U_1 \subset \mathbb{P}^1
  \end{equation}
  This maps is bijective, with inverse 
  \begin{equation}
    [\zeta_0 : \zeta_1] = \big[ \frac{\zeta_0}{\zeta_1} : 1 \big] \mapsto \frac{\zeta_0}{\zeta_1} = z
  \end{equation}

  What we missed is 
  \begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}^1 \setminus U_1 & = \{ [\zeta_0: 0] \colon \zeta_0 \neq 0\} \\ 
                               & = \{ [1 : 0] \}
  \end{align}
  which is just one point. We call $[1 : 0] = \infty$, i.e. the point at infinity. So we have 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}^1 = U_1 \sqcup \{[1 : 0]\}  = \mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}
  \end{equation}
  Conway calls this space $\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$, but we also call is $\mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\} = \mathbb{RP}^1$. But to talk about a compactification, we must extend the topology of $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$ by declaring 
  \begin{equation}
    B(\infty, \frac{1}{r}) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |z| > r \} \cup \{\infty\}
  \end{equation}
  to be in the basis of $+\infty = [1 : 0] \in \mathbb{P}^1$. 

  \begin{exercise}
    Show that rational functions $F = [P : Q] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ are continuous. 
  \end{exercise}

  Finally, $\mathbb{P}^1$ is also known as the Riemann sphere because $\mathbb{P}^1$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$. We can identify $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R}$, embed $S^2$ in $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R}$ s.t. 
  \begin{equation}
    S^2 = \{ (z, t) \in \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R} \colon |z|^2 + |t|^2 = 1 \}
  \end{equation}
  and the map is 
  \begin{equation}
    \phi(z) = \bigg( \frac{2z}{|z|^2 + 1}, \frac{|z|^2 - 1}{|z|^2 + 1} \bigg) \in S^2 \subset \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R}
  \end{equation}

\subsection{Rational Functions} 

  Suppose $P \in \mathbb{C}[\zeta_0 : \zeta_1]_d$. Then $p(z) = P(z, 1) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq d$. Now conversely, suppose that $p(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ is a polynomial of degree $d$. We get a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]$ by a process called ``homoegenization.'' 
  \begin{equation}
    P(\zeta) = P(\zeta_0, \zeta_1) = \zeta_1^d p (\zeta_0 / \zeta_1)
  \end{equation} 
  If $p(z) = \sum_{j=0}^d a_j z^j$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    P(\zeta) = \zeta_1^d \sum_{j=0}^d a_j \Big( \frac{\zeta_0}{\zeta_1} \Big)^j = \sum_{j=0}^d a_j \zeta_0^j \zeta_1^{d-j}
  \end{equation}
  So we have a way of toggling back and forth between two variable homogenous polynomials and one variable nonhomogeneous polynomials. 

  Given $P, Q \in \mathbb{C}[\zeta_0, \zeta_1]_d$, we have the map $F = [P : Q] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$. Then, we have 

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering 
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \mathbb{P}^1 \arrow[r, "F = {[P : Q]}"] & \mathbb{P}^1 \\
      \mathbb{C} \arrow[u, "i"] & 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \caption{} 
  \end{figure}

  Notice that $F \circ i : z \in \mathbb{C} \mapsto [z : 1] \mapsto [p(z) : q(z)] = \big[ \frac{p(z)}{q(z)} : 1 \big]$. When convenient, we will conflate $F$ with $\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}$. 


\subsection{Mobius Transformations} 

  Let $A \in \mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C}$ and let $[A] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be the Mobius transformation $[\zeta] \to [A \zeta]$. It is not hard to see that  
  \begin{align}
    [A] [B] & = [AB] \\ 
    [A]^{-1} & = [A^{-1}]
  \end{align}
  Therefore, the set of all mobius transformations, 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{PGL}_2 \mathbb{C} = \{ [A] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1 \text{ s.t. } A \in \mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C} \}
  \end{equation}
  is a group. And the map $\mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C} \to \mathrm{PGL}_2 \mathbb{C}$ is a group homomorphism. The kernel is the scalar multiple of identity maps. Suppose $A \in \mathrm{ker}$, so $[A] : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ is the identity, so this means that it preserves every 1-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^2$. Therefore, the whole space must be an eigenspace. Therefore, 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{PGL}_2 \mathbb{C} = \mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C}  (C \times I) = \mathrm{SL}_2 \mathbb{C} / \{\pm I\} 
  \end{equation}
  Let's write 
  \begin{equation}
    A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \mathrm{GL}_2 \mathbb{C}
  \end{equation} 
  Then, the composition $[A] \circ \iota : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{P}^1$ sends 
  \begin{equation}
    z \xrightarrow{\iota} [z : 1] \xrightarrow{[A]} [az + b : cz + d] = \bigg[ \frac{az + b}{cz + d} : 1 \bigg]
  \end{equation}
  When convenient, we will conflate $[A]$ with $S_A (z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$. 

  \begin{exercise}
    Suppose $\xi_0, \xi_1, \xi_2$ are pairwise disjoint points in $\mathbb{P}^1 = \mathbb{C}_\infty$. Then, the Mobius transformation 
    \begin{equation}
      S(z) = \frac{z - \xi_0}{z - \xi_\infty} \cdot \frac{\xi_1 - \xi_\infty}{\xi_1 - \xi_0}
    \end{equation}
    maps $\xi_0 \to 0$, $\xi_1 \to 1$, $\xi_\infty \to \infty$. Therefore, given that I choose three such numbers and you choose three such numbers, there is a Mobius transformation that can send my three numbers to your three numbers simply by mapping it through $0, 1, \infty$. Show that 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item This Mobius transformation satisfying $\xi_0 \to 0$, $\xi_1 \to 1$, $\xi_\infty \to \infty$ is unique. There are many ways to approach this, with the alegebraic argument a bit tedious, but the geometric is another way. 
      \item Suppose a Mobius transformation $T$ fixes 3 distinct points in $\mathbb{C}_\infty$. Show that $T$ is the identity. This is a straightforward consequence of (a). 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exercise}

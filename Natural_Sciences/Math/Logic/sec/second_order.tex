\section{Second-Order Logic} 

  First order logic can quantify over individuals, but not over properties. That is, while we can state something like 

  \begin{center}
    \textit{There exists x such that x is a cube.}
  \end{center} 

  we cannot quantify over a predicate. That is, the statement 
  
  \begin{center}
    \textit{There exists a property $P$ such that a cube satisfies $P$.}
  \end{center}

  This statement does not make sense in first-order logic, but makes sense in second-order logic.

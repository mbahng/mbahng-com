\section{Metric Topologies}

  In $\mathbb{R}$, note that every open ball is really just an interval. In fact, every open ball $(x - r, x + r)$ can be expressed with just two elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, as $(a, b)$. Notice that this method of expressing an open set does not even require any metric! Extending this to $\mathbb{R}^n$ would indicate that the topologies of $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by the endpoint of the open intervals would not necessarily induce any metric either. Notice that these induced topologies is \textbf{not} the open ball topology, which must have an associated metric to it. Rather, this induced, non-metric topology is the box topology! While the box topology and the open ball topology are really the same topology, they are generated by inherently different bases. 

\subsection{Convergence}

  \begin{theorem}[Sufficient Conditions for Convergence in Metric Space]
    Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in a metric space $X$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(x_n)$ converges to $x \in X$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ contains $x_n$ for all but finitely many $n$. 
      \item If $(x_n)$ converges to $x$, then $x$ is unique. 
      \item If $(x_n)$ converges, then $(x_n)$ is bounded. 
      \item If $E \subset X$ and $x$ is a limit point of $E$, then there exists a sequence $(x_n)$ in $E$ that converges to $x$. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Listed. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item ($\implies$) Let $x_n \rightarrow x \in X$. Then, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $d(x, x_n) < \epsilon$ for all $n > N$. Given neighborhood $B_\epsilon (x), x_n \in B_\epsilon (x)$ for all $n > N \implies$ at most $N$ elements are not in $B_\epsilon (x)$. ($\impliedby$) Now for any $\epsilon > 0$, let every $B_\epsilon (x)$ contain all but finitely many $x_n$. Enumerate them $\{x_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^K$, and let 
      \begin{equation}
        \alpha = \max \{n_k\}
      \end{equation}
      This means that there exists an $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $x_n \in B_\epsilon (x)$ for all $n > \alpha$, which implies that $x_n \rightarrow x$. 

      \item Assume $\{x_n\}$ converges to $x, x^\prime \in X$, with $x \neq x^\prime$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N_1, N_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $d(x, x_n) < \epsilon$ for all $n > N_1$ and $d(x^\prime, x_n) < \epsilon$ for all $n > N_2$. This means that there exists a $N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$ satisfying the above. Since $x \neq x^\prime$, set $\epsilon = d(x, x^\prime) /2$. Then, 
      \begin{equation}
        d(x, x_n) < \frac{d(x, x^\prime)}{2} \text{ and } d(x^\prime, x_n) < \frac{d(x, x^\prime)}{2}
      \end{equation}
      which implies that by adding both sides and invoking triangle inequality, we have 
      \begin{equation}
        d(x, x^\prime) \leq d(x, x_n) + d(x^\prime, x_n) < d(x, x^\prime)
      \end{equation}
      which is absurd. 

      \item Choose any $\epsilon > 0$. Then from (a), $B_\epsilon (x)$ contains all but finitely many $V = \{x_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^K$. Take 
      \begin{equation}
        M = \max \{\epsilon, d(x_{n_1}, x), \ldots, d(x_{n_K}, x)\}
      \end{equation}
      and so $d(x, x_n) < M$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.\footnote{This is also a direct result of every metric topology being Hausdorff.}

      \item We can explicitly construct one. Let $x \in E^\prime$. Then choose $\epsilon = 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots$ and for every $\epsilon > 0$, $B_\epsilon (x) \cap E \neq \emptyset$. Choose a $x_n$ within this intersection for every $\epsilon = \frac{1}{n}$. Then, we have $\{x_n\}$ contained in $E$. We want to show that this converges to $x$. Take any $\epsilon > 0$, then there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $0 < \frac{1}{N} < \epsilon$, and for every $n > N$, $\frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{N} < \epsilon$.
      \begin{equation}
        n > N \implies x_n \in B_{1/n} (x) \subset B_\epsilon (x)
      \end{equation}
      which means that $x_n \in B_\epsilon (x)$ for all $n > N$, implying that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n = x$. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}[Sequence Converges iff Every Subsequence Converges]
    $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ if and only if every subsequence of $(x_n)$ converges to $x$. 
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $x_n \rightarrow x$. Then, take any subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ of $(x_n)$. For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $d(x, x_n) < \epsilon$ for all $n > N$. Since $N$ is finite and the $n_k$'s are unbounded, there must exist a $K \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $n_k > N$ if $k > K$. Therefore, given any $\epsilon > 0$, we have proved the existence of a $K \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $k > K \implies n_k > N$, which implies by convergence of $x_n$, that 
    \begin{equation}
      d(x_{n_k}, x) < \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    which by definition means that $x_{n_k}$ converges to $x$. Now, for the other direction, given $(x_n)$ with every subsequence converging to $x$, we can take the subsequence $(x_n)$ itself ($n_k = k$), which converges to $x$. 
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem}[Nested Compact Sets]
    Listed. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $\overline{E}$ is the closure of a set $E$ in a metric space $X$, then 
      \begin{equation}
        \diam{\overline{E}} = \diam{E}
      \end{equation}

      \item If $K_n$ is a sequence of compact sets in $X$ s.t. $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and if 
      \begin{equation}
        \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \diam{K_n} = 0
      \end{equation}
      then $\cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n$ consists of exactly one point. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    
  \end{proof}
  
  \begin{theorem}[Subsequential Limits form Closed Subset]
    The subsequential limits of a sequence $(x_n)$ in a metric space form a closed subset of $X$. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $E$ be the set of subsequential limits and $y \in E^\prime$ be a limit point of $E$. We must show that $y \in E$.\footnote{Intuitively, we can see that $y$ is infinitesimally close to $E$, which consists of points infinitesimally close to $(x_n)$, and so $y$ should be infinitesimally close to $(x_n)$.} We will construct a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to $y$. Given any $\epsilon > 0$, we can see that the $B_{\epsilon/2} (y) \cap E \neq \emptyset$, so choose an element $z_\epsilon$. Furthermore, $z_\epsilon$ means that it is a limit point of $(x_n)$, and so $B_{\epsilon/2} (z) \cap \{x_n\} \neq \emptyset$, call this $x(\epsilon)$. Therefore, by the triangle inequality, 
    \begin{equation}
      |y - x(\epsilon)| \leq |y - z| + |z - x(\epsilon)| = \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    and so we can take a point from the sequence $(x_n)$ for every $\epsilon$. Now we do this for $\epsilon = 1/n$, and choose $n_k$ that is greater than its previous by restricting the sequence to that past $n_{k-1}$. Doing this gives a subsequence which converges to $y$. Therefore $y \in E$. 
  \end{proof}

\subsection{Properties} 

  As we will see in the following theorems, compact sets behave well with closed sets. In fact, compactness is in a form a stronger notion than closedness. 

  \begin{theorem}[Compact Subsets of Metric Spaces are Closed]
    Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Metric spaces are Hausdorff, and compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed. Note that this is what we essentially do in the more elementary 2nd proof below. 
  \end{proof}
  \begin{proof}
    We would like to show that if $A$ is compact in $X$, then $A^c$ is open. What we would like to do is if we have some $x \in A^c$, then we must prove that there exists some open set $B_\epsilon (x)$ that is disjoint with $A$. For every point $a \in A$, we can construct an open balls $V_a = B_{d(x, a)/2} (a)$ and $U_a = B_{d(x, a)/2} (x)$. We know that if $y \in B_{d(x, a)/2}(a)$, then assuming $y \in B_{d(x, a)/2} (x)$ will give
    \begin{equation}
      d(x, a) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, a) < \frac{d(x, a)}{2} + \frac{d(x, a)}{2} = d(x, a)
    \end{equation}
    which is absurd. 
    Since $\{V_a\}_{a \in A}$ forms an open covering of $A$, then by compactness we can take a finite subcover $V_{a_1}, \ldots, V_{a_n}$, along with the respective neighborhoods of $x$ $U_{a_1}, \ldots, U_{a_n}$. Since we have established 
    \begin{equation}
      V_{a_i} \cap U_{a_i} = \emptyset \implies \bigcap_{i=1}^n V_{a_i} \cap \bigg( \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_{a_i} \bigg) = \emptyset
    \end{equation}
    and since $\cap_{i=1}^n V_{a_i}$ is open (as it is the intersection of open sets) and disjoint from an open cover of $A$ and hence from $A$, we have proved that $A^c$ is open, and so $A$ is closed. 
  \end{proof}

  In fact, compactness actually implies completeness. 

  \begin{theorem}
    Compact metric spaces are complete. 
  \end{theorem} 

\subsection{Bounded Metric}

  \begin{definition}[Bounded Set]
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space with subset $A$. $A$ is \textbf{bounded} if there exists some number $M$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      d (x, y) \leq M \text{ for all } x,y \in A
    \end{equation}
    If $A$ is bounded, the \textbf{diameter} of $A$ is defined to be the number
    \begin{equation}
      \text{diam}\, A \equiv \sup{\{d(x, y) \mid x, y \in A\}}
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}

  Note that boundedness on a set is not a topological property since it depends on the particular metric $d$ that is used for $X$. For example, we can construct the following metric that makes every subset in $X$ bounded. 

  \begin{definition}[Standard Bounded Metric]
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. We define a second metric $\Tilde{d}$ on $X$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      \Tilde{d} (x, y) \equiv \min{\{d(x, y), 1\}}
    \end{equation}
    $\Tilde{d}$ is called the \textbf{standard bounded metric corresponding to $d$}. 
  \end{definition}

  If we construct open balls with this metric, it is easy to see that they consist of all open balls with radius less than or equal to 1. That is, the topology $\T$ consists of all open balls
  \begin{equation}
    \T \equiv \{B_r (x) \mid x \in X, r \leq 1\}
  \end{equation}
  It is also clear that the topology induced by $\Tilde{d}$ is the same as the topology induced by $d$! The significance of this construction of the standard bounded metric is that we can now work with a basis consisting of bounded elements, which is much nicer than a basis of open balls that can have arbitrarily large radii.  

  We now introduce a metrization theorem on $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

  \begin{theorem}
    The topologies on $\mathbb{R}^n$ induced by the Euclidean metric $d$ and the square metric $\rho$ are the same as the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Given $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, simple algebra shows that 
    \begin{align*}
      & \rho(x, y) \leq d(x, y) \leq \sqrt{n} \rho(x, y) \\
      & \;\;\;\; \implies \forall x, \epsilon, \; B_d (x, \epsilon) \subset B_\rho (x, \epsilon) \text{ and } B_\rho (x, \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{n}}) \subset B_d (x, \epsilon)
    \end{align*}
    But
    \begin{equation}
      \{ B_\rho (x, \epsilon) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}\} = B_\rho (x, \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{n}}) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}\}
    \end{equation}
    which means that the metric topology induced by $d$ is the same as the metric topology induced by $\rho \implies$ the two topologies are the same. We know that the topology induced by $\rho$ is the same as the product topology since 
    \begin{equation}
      \prod_{i=1}^n (x_i - r, x_i + r) = \bigcup_{k=1}^n \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \times (x_k - r, x_k + r) \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}

  With this theorem, we have proved that given a topological space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the product topology, there exists a metric (the Euclidean and square metric) that induces this product topology. We can attempt to extrapolate these formulas to $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ by defining
  \begin{align*}
    & d(x, y) \equiv \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2 \bigg)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
    & \rho(x, y) \equiv \sup{\{|x_i - y_i|\}}
  \end{align*}
  However, the metrics do not in general map to elements of $\mathbb{R}$, since the sequence $(x_i - y_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ could diverge. Therefore, we can redefine the metric $\rho$ to the following bounded one. 
  \begin{equation}
    \Tilde{\rho} (x, y) \equiv \sup{\{\Tilde{d}(x_i, y_i)\}}
  \end{equation}
  where $\Tilde{d}$ is the standard bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$. Clearly,
  \begin{equation}
    0 \leq \Tilde{\rho}(x, y) \leq 1
  \end{equation}
  $\Tilde{\rho}$ is indeed a metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, but unfortunately, it does not induce the product topology. We extend this definition to arbitrary $\mathbb{R}^J$. 
  
  \begin{definition}[Uniform Metric]
    Given an indexed set $J$ with points $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^J$, we define
    \begin{equation}
      \Tilde{\rho} \equiv \sup{\{\Tilde{d}(x_\alpha, y_\alpha)\;|\; \alpha \in J\}}
    \end{equation}
    with $\Tilde{d}$ the standard bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$. $\Tilde{\rho}$ is called the \textbf{uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^J$}, which induces the \textbf{uniform topology}. 
  \end{definition}

  The uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^J$ is finer than the product topology, and they are different if $J$ is infinite. Clearly, $0 \leq \Tilde{p} (x, y) \leq 1$, meaning that given the open ball
  \begin{equation}
    B_r (x) \equiv \{y \in \mathbb{R}^J \;|\; \Tilde{p}(y, x) < r\}
  \end{equation}
  if $r \geq 1$, then $B_r (x) = \mathbb{R}^J$ and if $r<1$, then $B_r (x)$ consists of the $n$-dimensional box with "radius" $r$, where $n = \dim{\mathbb{R}^J}$. 


  The next theorem gives us a metric that induces the product topology on infinite dimensional $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ by slightly modifying the uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}$. However, with the box topology $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is not metrizable. 

  \begin{theorem}
    Let $\Tilde{d} (a, b) \equiv \min{\{|a-b|, 1\}}$ be the standard bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$. If $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^\omega$, we define
    \begin{equation}
      D(x, y) \equiv \sup{\Big\{ \frac{\Tilde{d}(x_i, y_i)}{i}\Big\}}
    \end{equation}
    Then, $D$ is a metric that induces the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. 
  \end{theorem}
  
  It is easy to see that $0 \leq D(x, y) \leq 1$. So, given the open ball
  \begin{equation}
    B_r (x) \equiv \{y \in \mathbb{R}^\omega \; | \; D(x, y) < r\}
  \end{equation}
  $B_r (x) = \mathbb{R}^\omega$ if $r > 1$. When $r \leq 1$, 
  \begin{equation}
    B_r (x) \equiv (y-r, y+r) \times (y-2r, y+2r) \times ... = \prod_{k=1}^\infty (y - k r , y + k r)
  \end{equation}

  We can extend the applications of the Bolzano Weierstrass Lemma from analysis to metric spaces in general with the following lemma. 

  \begin{lemma}[Sequence Lemma]
    If $X$ be a topological space with $A \subset X$. If there exists a sequence of points of $A$ that converges to $x$, then $x \in \bar{A}$. The converse is true if $X$ is metrizable. 
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    $(\rightarrow)$ Our hypothesis says that $x$ is a limit point of $A$, which by definition means that $x \in \bar{A}$. \\
    $(\leftarrow)$ Assuming $X$ is metrizable and $x \in \bar{A}$, let $d$ be a metric for the topology of $X$. Then, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let us define a sequence of open neighborhoods of $x$ to be
    \begin{equation}
      \big(B_{\frac{1}{n}} (x) \big)
    \end{equation}
    Since $x \in \bar{A}$, there exists a point 
    \begin{equation}
      x_n \in A \cap B_{\frac{1}{n}} (x) \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N}
    \end{equation}
    This sequence $(x_n)$ that we have proved must exist converges to $x$. 
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem}
    Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ and let $X$ be metrizable. $f$ is continuous if and only if for every convergent sequence $(x_n) \rightarrow x$ of $X$, the following sequence of $Y$ converges to $f(x)$. That is, 
    \begin{equation}
      \big( f(x_n) \big) \longrightarrow f(x)
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem}

  We introduce additional methods of constructing continuous functions. 

  \begin{definition}[Uniform Convergence]
    Let $f_n: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a sequence of functions from the set $X$ to the metric space $(Y, d)$. The sequence $(f_n)$ is said to \textbf{converge uniformly} to the function $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ if, given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      d\big( f_n(x), f(x)\big) < \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    for all $n \geq N$ and for all $x \in X$. 
  \end{definition}

  \begin{theorem}[Uniform Limit Theorem]
    Let $f_n: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a sequence of continuous functions from topological space $X$ to a metric space $Y$. If $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$, then $f$ is continuous. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    $(\rightarrow)$ Trivial. \\
    $(\leftarrow)$ Let $V$ be open in $Y$, and let $x_0$ be a point in $f^{-1} (V)$. It suffices to prove that for every $x_0 \in f^{-1} (V)$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $U \subset F^{-1} (V)$ or equivalently, $F(U) \subset V$. 

    Let $y_0 = f(x_0)$. Since $Y$ is a metric space with metric $d$, we know that there exists an $\epsilon$-ball $B_\epsilon (y_0)$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      B_\epsilon (y_0) \subset V
    \end{equation}
    Then, using uniform convergence, we can choose $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and all $x \in X$, 
    \begin{equation}
      d \big( f_n (x), f(x) \big) < \frac{\epsilon}{4}
    \end{equation}
    which also applies at the point $x = x_0$. 
    \begin{equation}
      d \big( f_n (x_0), f(x_0) \big) < \frac{\epsilon}{4}
    \end{equation}
    Using continuity of $f_n$, choose a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $f_n$ carries $U$ into the open $\epsilon/2$-ball centered at $f_n (x_0)$ (note that $f_n (x_0) \neq y_0$), meaning that if $x \in U$
    \begin{equation}
      d \big( f_n (x), f_n (x_0) \big) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
    \end{equation}
    Adding the three inequalities and using the triangle inequality, we get the fact that if $x \in U$, then 
    \begin{equation}
      d \big( f(x), f(x_0) \big) < \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    meaning that the $f(U) \subset B_\epsilon (x_0) \subset V$.

  \begin{theorem}
    In a metric space $(X, d)$, a set is \textbf{closed} if the limit of every convergent subsequence in $X$ lies in $X$. That is, $X$ contains all of its limit points. 
  \end{theorem}

<p class="title">Personal Notes: Economics, Business, & Finance</p>
<p class="intro_text"> The following are the topics I have studied (and will be planning to study) during my time in the Korean military until November 2022. As these notes are primarily for my personal use, I did not spend as much time writing them in a manner that is clear for all readers. But since it would be a waste not to share them, I uploaded them on this website. All of my personal notes are free to download, use, and distrbute under the Creative Commons "Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International" license. Please contact me if you find any errors in my notes or have any further questions. I have used the LaTeX editing program Overleaf to create my notes; diagrams are often drawn using the tikz package or iPad Notes.</p>

<h2>United States: Basic Facts </h2>

Employment Rates & Bankruptcies 
Individuals mainly file for one of two of the following: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Chapter 7</b>, a liquidation bankruptcy, which involves selling some or all your property to pay off your debts. </li>
  <li><b>Chapter 13</b>, a reorganization bankruptcy, which allows you to keep your property under a court-mandated repayment plan (essentially delays your payment). </li>
</ul>
Corporations mainly file for one of two of the following: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Chapter 7</b> liquidates the company's assets.</li>
  <li><b>Chapter 11</b> allows the business to continue to operate under a reorganization plan. </li>
</ul>
Municipalities (cities, towns, villages, etc.) may use: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Chapter 9</b> relates more to debt reduction and overseeing, since it is nearly impossible for the municipality's creditor to force the liquidation of its assets. </li>

<h2><a name=corporate>Industry & Corporate Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Basic Income and Expenses of a Company</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Operating Expenses (OPEX)</b>: Expenses needed to operate/maintain the business (sometimes synonymous with SG&A). In the broader sense, we can think of it as: COGS + SG&A + R&D + D&A</li>
    <li><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b>: The direct costs associated with producing goods (e.g. direct materials, direct labor, equipment costs, overhead costs for facility).</li>
    <li><b>Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A)</b>: Typically costs associated with a company's overall overhead. It can be thought of as all non-COGS operational expenses. (e.g. accounting, legal, corporate office overhead, advertising, marketing, rent)</li>
    <li><b>Research & Development (R&D)</b>: Reseach & Development (which are tax-deductible) </li>
    <li><b>Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)</b>: The depreciation of CAPEX assets are accounted for in here. </li>
    <li><b>Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)</b>: Purchases that a business makes as an investment (e.g. real estate, factory, computers, furniture, intellectual property, copyrights, patents) to help it generate more revenue. CAPEX purchases are not immediately reported on an income statement. Rather, it is treated as an asset on the balance sheet, that is deducted over the course of several years as a depreciation expense in D&A. Ideally, the increase in revenue made from this CAPEX investment would outweigh the depreciation rate of the investment.  </li>
    <li><b>Revenue</b>:  Total Worth of a company's goods & services sold</li>
    <li><b>Gross Profit</b>: Revenue - COGS </li>
    <li><b>EBITDA</b>: Gross Profit - SG&A - R&D</li>
    <li><b>Operating Income/EBIT</b>: Revenue - OPEX</li>
    <li><b>Net Income</b>: Operating Income - Taxes - Interest Expenses on Debts</li>
  </ul>

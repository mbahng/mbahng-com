<h4>Non-Volatile Drive Storage</h4>
A <b>drive</b> is basically a computer component used to store data. It may be a static storage device (e.g. a HDD or SSD) or may use removable media (e.g. thumb, disk, CD). All drives store <b>nonvolatile data</b> (also called nonvolatile memory, NVM), meaning that the data is not erased when the power is turned off.

<ul>
  <li>A <b>floppy disk drive</b> is a portable circular floppy plastic/metal disk coated with iron oxide or other magnetic material. They come in many sizes ranging from 3~8 inches in diameter, with the standard capacity being 1.44MB. When inserting the floppy disk into a computer, there is a read/write head that uses a magnet to polarize the iron particles in one of two directions, each represting a 0 or 1 in binary data. The head can also read these polarities in order to retrieve data stored on the disk in the form of polarized particles. Note that the head would read the disk "circularly" as the disk rotates. Each disk would be divided into typically 40 tracks with around 8 equal sectors.</li>
  <li>A <b>hard disk drive (HDD)</b> is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid (hence, the name hard) rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. Data is accessed in arandom-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. They usually come inside a metal case enclosing the entire drive (3.5-inch for computers and 2.5-inch for laptop HDDs). Since the data on the HDD is determined by the polarities of the magnetic material on the disks, it is sensitive to external magnetic fields that may corrupt the data. Furthermore, because the drive heads must align over an area of the disk in order to read or write data, and the disk is constantly spinning, there’s a delay before data can be accessed. The drive may need to read from multiple locations in order to launch a program or load a file, which means it may haveto wait for the platters to spin into the proper position multiple times before it can complete the command. If a drive is asleep or in a low-power state, it can take several seconds more for the disk to spin up to full power and begin operating. Their speeds are measured in RPM, with the normal range of desktop HDDs having 5400-7200 RPM. It is useful to know that 5400 RPM drives offer an average of 100MB/s read and 7200 RPM drives offer 120MB/s.</li>
  <li>A <b>Solid State Drive (SSD)</b> is an extra step up from the HDD. From the very beginning, it was clear that hard drives couldn’t possibly match the speeds at which CPUs could operate. Latency in HDDs is measured in milliseconds, compared with nanoseconds for your typical CPU. One millisecond is 1,000,000 nanoseconds, and it typically takes a hard drive 10-15 milliseconds to find data on the drive and begin reading it. The hard drive industry introduced smaller platters, on-disk memory caches, and faster spindle speeds to counteract this trend, but there’s only so fast drives can spin. Western Digital’s 10,000 RPM VelociRaptor family is the fastest set of drives ever built for the consumer market, while some enterprise drives spun as quickly as 15,000 RPM. The problem is, even the fastest spinning drive with the largest caches and smallest platters are still achingly slow as far as your CPU is concerned.
  Unlike HDDs, soid state drives do not need moving parts or spinning disks (hence their name). Instead, it uses NAND flash memory, which is a type of non-volatile storage that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the Byte level. It also retains data for decades, regardless of whether the device is powered on or off. It is used in not only SSD, but also USB flash drives, SD cards, mobile phones, digital cameras, tablets, and others. 
  The most fundamental unit of storage is the flash memory cell, which uses electron thresholds to hold certain bits of information, usually three bits (called TLC - triple level cell) or four bits (called QLC - quad level cell). If is no electron charge in the cell, the cell represents a 111 (for TLC) and 1111 (for QLC). Since each cell can store multiple bits of information, they are arranged in a large array (consisting of millions of cells stacked on top of each other) into a block, leading to a typical storage between 256KB and 4MB.</li>
</ul>

Furthermore, each type of drive on a computer are assigned a <b>device/drive letter</b>, a single alphabetic character A through Z. 
Computers containing a hard drive always have that default hard drive assigned to a C: drive letter, and external drives may be assigned
different letters, such as Google Drive being assigned a G: drive letter. 
You may also notice that when opening the command prompt on windows, the leftmost letter represents which drive you are currently on. Note that the "wmic" is an abbreviation of Windows Management Interface Command. Some commands may require you to use an <b>elevated command prompt</b>, which can be used by opening the cmd file as an administrator.

<h4>Volatile, Short-Term Storage</h4>
Information travels from drives and other stores to the CPU, but the physical distance that the bits must travel across the motherboard also puts an upper limit on the retrieval speed (i.e. the speed of electromagnetic waves), especially if the distance must be covered thousands or millions of times back and forth. This limit is known as <b>latency</b>. This is why computers have a hierarchy of stores reserved for information that is accessed more frequently, some closer to the CPU and others even within the CPU itself!

<ul>
  <li><b>Random Access Memory</b>, or <b>RAM</b>, is short-term memory that acts as a cache for the CPU that is 50-200 times faster than a regular SSD. It is volatile, meaning that all its memory is erased when the computer shuts down. The most recent type of RAM is DDR4, then DDR3, followed by DDR2, DDR, and SDRAM. In addition the speeds of RAM is
    <ul>
      <li>DDR4: 2133mhz, 2400mhz, 2666mhz, 3200mhz</li>
      <li>DDR3: 1066mhz, 1300mhz, 1600mhz, 1866mhz</li>
    </ul>
    where the mhz value represents how many times per second the RAM can access its memory. However, know that some motherboards have technical limitations to what kind of RAM speed it can handle, so in these cases, the system will throttle your faster RAM stick to meet this need. 
    In terms of capacity, the following gives us nice benchmarks. 
    <ul>
      <li>4-8 GB: Laptops for web browsing and light gaming (e.g. my Macbook Air 2019)</li>
      <li>16-32 GB: Laptops for gaming (possibly heavy) and programming</li>
      <li>64-128 GB: Crazy stuff. </li>
      <li>256 GB: This basically means you have a RAM that is pretty much the size of a typical SSD. </li>
    </ul>
  Finally, there are broad categories of RAM. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Static RAM (SRAM)</b> requires a constant power flow in order to function and therefore doesn't need to be refreshed to keep the data intact (hence the name static). Note that this does not mean that SRAM is nonvolatile. Therefore, the SRAM is typically used in CPU caches or video cards. </li>
    <li><b>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</b> requires a periodic refresh of power in order to function. The capacitors that store data in DRAM gradually discharge energy (no energy means the data becomes lost). DRAM is found in systems memory and video graphics memory.</li>
    <li><b>Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM)</b> is a DRAM that operates in sync with the CPU clock, which means that it waits for the clock signal before responding to data input. This is advantageous since the CPU can process overlapping instructions in parallel, known as <b>pipelining</b> (the ability to reveive an instruction before the previous instruction has been fully resolved). This allows more instructions to be completed simultaneously. By contrast, DRAM is asynchronous, which means it responsd immediately to user input. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>CPU caches</b> have a hierarchy that is divided into (from fastest to slowest) L1, L2, L3, and sometimes even L4. The CPU will check the L1 cache first to see if there is a hit (if there is, then data is retrieved extremely fast), then the L2, and so on. 
    <ul>
      <li>L1: 8-64 KB storage typically (but there are exceptions, i.e. the Apple M1 chip has a 192 KB L1 cache) </li>
      <li>L2: 256KB-8MB storage</li>
      <li>L3: 10-64MB storage (and sometimes up to 256MB for server chips)</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

For my computer, the outputs are as such. It shows two memory sticks each with 8GB of memory, a memory type of 0 which is a DDR4 (type 24 means DDR3), speeds of 3200 mhz, and TypeDetail of 128 which means the RAM is synchronous (SDRAM).

First, we review some definitions. More on program lifecycle phases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_lifecycle_phase" target=BLANK>here</a>. 
<ul>
  <li>Programming languages are broadly classified into two types. <b>High-level languages</b> are the familiar programming languages that we work with today (that allow much more abstraction), while <b>low-level languages</b> are very close to the hardware, such as machine language and assembly language. </li> <br>
  <li>Programmers write programs in <b>source code</b> (usually high-level languages), which are then inputted into <b>language processors</b> that translate them into <b>object code</b> (usually <b>machine code</b> consisting of binary). The duration in which the source code of the program is being edited is called the <b>edit time</b>, while the <b>compile time</b> is when the source code is translated into machine code by a language processor. There are three types of language processors. 
  <ul>
    <li>A <b>compiler</b> is a language processor that reads the complete source program written in high-level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language. The source code is translated to object code successfully if it is free of errors. The compiler specifies the errors at the end of the compilation with line numbers when there are any errors in the source code. The errors must be removed before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code again. (e.g. C, C++, C#, Java)</li>
    <li>An <b>assmebler</b> is used to translate the program written in <b>Assembly language</b> (basically a low-level language with very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the machine code instructions) into machine code. The assembler is basically the 1st interface that is able to communicate humans with the machine. We need an assembler to fill the gap between human and machine so that they can communicate with each other. Code written in assembly language is some sort of mnemonics (instructions) like ADD, MUL, MUX, SUB, DIV, MOV and so on, and the assembler is basically able to convert these mnemonics into binary code. </li>
    <li>An <b>interpreter</b> translates a single statement of the source program into machine code and executes immediately before moving on to the next line. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates its translating at that statement and displays an error message. The interpreter moves on to the next line for execution only after the removal of the error. An interpreter directly executes instructions written source code without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. (e.g. Python, Pearl, JavaScript, Ruby)</li>
  </ul>
  A quick compare and contrast. 
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Compiler</th>
      <th>Interpreter</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Takes more time to analyze source code but execution time is faster. </td>
      <td>Takes less time to analyze source code but execution time is slower. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Debugging is harder since compiler generates error message after entire scan. </td>
      <td>Debugging is easier since interpreter continues translating the program until error is met. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Requires a lot of memory for generating object codes. </td>
      <td>Requires less memory because no object code is generated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Generates intermediate object code. </td>
      <td>No intermediate object code is generated. </td>
    </tr>
  </table></li><br>
  <li>
    The result of a successful compilation is an executable, which is a program in the form of a file containing millions of lines of very simple machine code instructions (e.g. add 2 numbers or compare 2 numbers), also called <b>processor instructions</b>. This executable can be stored somewhere in the computer drive for future use or it may be copied immediately in a faster memory state, such as the RAM. The <b>load time</b> is when the OS takes the program's executable from storage and puts it into an active memory (e.g. RAM) in order to begin execution. 
    <br><br>
    The CPU understands only a low level machine code language (aka native code), which is contained within the executable. The language of the machine code is hardwired into the design of the CPU hardware; it is not something that can be changed at will. Each family of compatible CPUs (e.g. the popular Intel x86 family) has its own, idiosyncratic machine code which is not compatible with the machine code of other CPU families. More information <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/software-1.html" target=BLANK>here</a>. 
    <br><br>
    Once the instruction bytes are copied from storage to RAM, the CPU can run through the steps/lines at the rate of about 2 billion lines/steps per second. This execution phase, when the CPU executes the instructions until normal termination or a crash, is called the <b>runtime</b>. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>More on Executables</h4>
More specifically, an <b>executable</b> is a file that contains a list of instructions and data to cause a computer's CPU to perform indicated tasks, as opposed to the data files, which are fundamentally strings of data that must be interpreted (parsed) by a program to be meaningful. Executables usually have extension names <code>.exe</code> or <code>.bat</code>, and they can generally be run (invoked) in two ways: 
<ul>
  <li>The executable file can be run by simply double clicking on the file name, opening it, and having the user type commands in an interactive session of an interpter (like inputting commands in terminal window or a python shell).</li>
  <li>Alternatively, we can start writing a program, complete writing it, and then have this program compiled into an executable to be invoked. </li>
</ul>
Some common examples of executables are: 
<ul>
  <li>python.exe - used to run python scripts that have the .py extension, located at <code>C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39</code></li> 
  <li>pythonw.exe - used to run .pyw files for GUI programs</li> 
  <li>terminal.exe (on MacOS)</li>
  <li>cmd.exe (on Windows OS)</li>
  <li>py.exe - an exuecutable used to run the python.exe executable like a shortcut, located at <code>C:\windows\py.exe</code></li> 
</ul>

When your device connects to a router in a LAN, it has a local IP address (usually starting with <code>172.30.</code> or <code>192.168.</code>). Packets of data leaves your comptuer address, from a <b>port</b> (out of the 2<sup>16</sup>=65,536 ports), to the router local IP address, known as the <b>default gateway</b>. This router then connects to the internet, which now has another address (which can be Googled) and forwards the packets through there.

When in an environment (whether it'd be a base or a virtual one), the environment has certain characteristics that are stored in what we call the <b>environment variables</b>. A list of then can be outputted with the commands below. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows CMD</th> 
    <th>MacOS Terminal</th>
    <th>Task</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>set</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Lists all the environment variables</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %&lt;VARIABLE&gt;%</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Returns the value of the environment variable</td>
  </tr>
</table>
A few of the first variables that are outputted on my system is shown here. 
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>set
ALLUSERSPROFILE=C:\ProgramData
APPDATA=C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Roaming
CommonProgramFiles=C:\Program Files\Common Files
CommonProgramFiles(x86)=C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files
CommonProgramW6432=C:\Program Files\Common Files
</pre>
They are all in the form 
<pre>
   NAME=VALUE
</pre>
where the NAMEs are conventionally written in uppercase (<code>&VARIABLE</code> for MacOS and <code>%VARIABLE%</code> for Windows), and the VALUEs are strings. The point of these variables is to communicated to programs how the machine is set up and sometimes to control the behavior of programs (e.g. where the home directory is, what user is logged in, etc.). 

One notable environment variable is the <b>PATH environment variable</b>, which is basically a set of directories where executable programs are located. More specifically, it specifies the directories in which executable programs are located on the machine that can be started without knowing and typing the whole path to the file on the command line. Note that the shell does not check subdirectories in PATH, only that directory itself. We can also modify which file extensions (other than the common <code>.exe</code>, <code>.bat</code>, etc.) is supported by editing <code>%PATHEXT%</code>. One can check this this set of directories with the following commands: 
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows CMD</th> 
    <th>MacOS Terminal</th>
    <th>Task</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %PATH%</td>
    <td>echo $PATH</td>
    <td>Specifies the directories in which executables are located on the machine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %PATHEXT%</td>
    <td>echo $PATHEXT</td>
    <td>Specifies the extensions that are supported by PATH and can therefore be called directly in cmd/terminal. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, calling <code>echo %PATHEXT%</code> on my Windows laptop returns the following supported executable extensions: </p>
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>echo %PATHEXT%
.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC
</pre>
<p>On MacOS, PATH usually holds all <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code> directories relevant for the current user. On Windows, it contains at least the <code>C:\Windows</code> and <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> directories. This is why you can run <code>calc.exe</code> or <code>notepad.exe</code> from the command line (you actually don't need to include the <code>.exe</code>, just <code>calc</code> will do), but not <code>chrome.exe</code> since it is located in <code>C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application</code>. <br>

Calling the PATH environment variable on my computer returns
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>echo %PATH%
C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common;C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA NvDLISR;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\mingw-w64\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\usr\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts
</pre>
and since I have <code>py.exe</code> installed in <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> (which is in PATH), I can call it immediately in cmd. However, the python.exe is located in <code>C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39</code>, which is currently not on the PATH variable and therefore cannot be called without specifying the <i>entire</i> path of <code>python.exe</code>. For convenience, we should modify the PATH variable to include the directory that <code>python.exe</code> is located in. Adding a directory to your PATH expands the # of directories that are searched when, from any directory, you enter a command in the shell. Unfortunately, modifying the PATH with the shell can be very dangerous, but there is an easy way to do it using a GUI explained very well through this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho" target="_blank">link</a>. All environment variables can be changed as explained in the link using the GUI (in the control panel).

<div id="section_content_6">
Remember that an environment really contains three things: 
<ul>
  <li>A <code>Lib\site-packages</code> directory that contains all the packages needed for the project. 
    <ul>
      <li>A <b>module</b> is a bunch of code in a file with the extension <code>.py</code>, in which there may be functions, classes, or variables defined. </li>
      <li>A <b>package</b> is a directory of a collection of modules (i.e. the folder that contains all modules). </li>
      <li>A <b>library</b> is an umbrella term referring to a reusable chunk of code, containing a collection of related modules and packages. It is sometimes used interchangeable with packages. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A scripts directory that contains various executables that will run your scripts with the help of packages imported. 
  <ul>
    <li>python.exe</li>
    <li>activate.bat</li>
    <li>pip.exe</li>
    <li>wheel.exe</li>
  </ul> </li>
  <li>Whatever scripts you have written as a part of your program.</li>
</ul>
Note that the scripts you have written as a part of your program is <i>not</i> within the virtual environment folder; it only contains the executable scripts and packages. Usually, the scripts would be contained one step above in the file tree of the virtual environment all within a bigger project folder. 
<br><br>
We must also distinguish two types of environments. 
<ul>
  <li>A <b>base environment</b>, which handles Python scripts on your entire system. The path for this environment is similar for most systems, but mine is <code>C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39</code>. 
  Note that the Python directory contains the scripts, while the Python39 directory is technically known as the environment. </li>
  <li>Multiple <b>virtual environments</b>, which are isolated environments designed for specific projects. The key benefit of virtual environments is that they isolate each of your projects from any other installation of Python on your computer, allowing multiple versions of Python to coexist without stepping on each other. However, they can be decenetralized, making it hard to manage and requiring activation/deactivation in a terminal-basis. Some of my own virtual environments are listed in different directories, but <code>venv</code> folder has the path: <code>C:\Users\bahng\PycharmProjects\HW_Problem_Generator\venv</code>. </li>
</ul>
Thankfully, there are multiple package managers that allows us to organize our environments. In addition to the information below, this <a href="https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-virtual-environments-and-dependency-managers/" target="BLANK">link</a> is also a great tutorial. It is conventional to use venv somewhere in the environment name, and it is easily available in ignore files like .gitignore. 
<br><br>
Some common virtual environment management programs. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Venv</b> is the default virtual environment module for Python 3 and one of the easiest modules for creating virtual environments. It comes pre-installed in Python3 or newer. 
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Windows CMD</th> 
        <th>MacOS Terminal</th>
        <th>Task</th>

      <tr>
        <td>python -m venv &lt;path_to_venv_directory/NAME&gt;</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Creates a new virtual environment directory named NAME in current directory by default or in path_to_venv_directory specified. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>activate.bat</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Activates the virtual environment. Remember to be in the scripts directory in order to run the executable. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>deactivate.bat</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Deactivates the virtual environment. Remember to be in the scripts directory in order to run the executable. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Note that one you have activated the virtual environment, the environment name should pop up in parantheses in your shell as such. 
    <pre class="terminal">
C:\User\bahng>python -m venv testvenv
C:\User\bahng>cd testvenv\Scripts
C:\Users\bahng\testvenv\Scripts>activate.bat
(venv) C:\Users\bahng\venv\Scripts> _
    </pre>
    Remember that virtual environments are just directories that contain a library of site-packages and a collection of executables. They can be installed anywhere on your computer, even in directories that have nothing to do with Python scripts. </li>
    <li><b>Virtualenv</b> is a third-party dependency manager used for creating and managing Python projects, but used mainly for Python 2 so we will not elaborate here. Note that virtual environments do not come as a native feature for Python 2. </li>
    <li><b>Conda</b> is another package manager that specializes in data science. You can download it by installing Anaconda or Miniconda (a mini-version of Anaconda that contains only Conda and its dependencies). Again, for ease of use, make sure you add conda to the PATH variable. Note that when you install conda, a directory called anaconda3 is made which contains a <i>new</i> base environment and additional virtual environment directories. Listing all the environments I have returns
<pre class="terminal">

      The asterick just means that I am currently in (i.e. have activated) the testenv environment.

Once we install and import the <code>datetime</code> package, we can see that every <code>datetime</code> object has 7 components: <b>year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond</b>. 
<ul>
  <li><code>dt.datetime.now()</code> returns the current datetime. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> import datetime as dt
>>> x = dt.datetime.now()
>>> x
datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 29, 23, 9, 41, 334025)
>>> print(x)
2021-11-29 23:09:41.334025
>>> type(x)
&lt;class 'datetime.datetime'>
</pre>
To create datetime objects, we use <code>dt.datetime(year, month, day)</code>. This can take in additional arguments for time (hour, minute, second, microsecond with default being <code>0</code>). 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> x = dt.datetime(2021, 11, 29)
>>> print(x)
2021-11-29 00:00:00
>>> y = dt.datetime(2021, 11, 29, 23, 16, 43, 23454)
>>> print(y)
2021-11-29 23:16:43.023454
</pre>
Given that we have a datetime, such as <code>y</code>, we can do multiple things: 
<ul>
  <li><code>y.weekday()</code> outputs a number representing the weekday (0: Mon, 1: Tues, 2: Wed, 3: Thurs, 4: Fri, 5: Sat, 6 Sun)</li>
  <li><code>y.date()</code> outputs only the date</li>
  <li><code>y.time()</code> outputs only the time</li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> y.weekday()
0
>>> print(y.date())
2021-11-29
>>> print(y.time())
23:16:43.023454
</pre>
Furthermore, we can use <code>dt.timedelta</code> to add or subtract a certain time from a <code>datetime</code> object. 
<ul>
  <li><code>dt.timedelta()</code> creates a <code>timedelta</code> object that we can add to a <code>datetime</code> object. </li>
  <li>Subtracting a <code>datetime</code> object from another <code>datetime</code> object returns a <code>timedelta</code> object. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> tday = dt.date.today()
>>> tdelta = dt.timedelta(days=7)
>>> print(tday)
2021-11-29
>>> nxtwk = tday + tdelta
>>> print(nxtwk)
2021-12-06
>>> print(nxtwk - tday)
7 days, 0:00:00
</pre>

<div class="subsection_title">Displaying DateTimes to Strings</div>
Given any <code>datetime</code> object <code>x</code>, <code>x.strftime(format)</code> converts it to a string. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> y = dt.datetime(2021, 11, 29, 23, 16, 43, 23454)
>>> print(y.strftime("%B"))

Furthermore, there are several important differences between numpy arrays and standard Python sequences. 
<ul>
  <li>Numpy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Canging the size of an <code>ndarray</code> will create a new array and delete the original. </li>
  <li>The elements in a Numpy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. </li>
  <li>Numpy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using python's built-in sequences. </li>
</ul>
The points about sequence size and speed are particularly important with scientific computing. As a simple example, consider the case of multiplying each element in a 1-D sequence with the corresponding element in another sequence of the same length. If the data are stored in two Python lists, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, we could iterate over each element: 
<pre class="terminal">
c = []
for i in range(len(a)):
    c.append(a[i] * b[i])
</pre>
This produces the correct answer, but if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> each contain millions of numbers, we will pay the price for the inefficienies of looping in Python. We could accomplish the same task much more quickly in C by writing: 
<pre class="terminal">
for (i = 0; i < rows; i++): {
  c[i] = a[i] * b[i];
}
</pre>
This saves all the overhead involved in interpreting the Python code and manipulating Python objects, but at the expense of the benefits gained from coding in Python. Furtherore, the coding work required increases with the dimensionality of our data. In the case of a 2-D array, the C code expands to 
<pre class="terminal">
for (i = 0; i < rows; i++): {
  for (j = 0; j < columns; j++): {
    c[i][j] = a[i][j] * b[i][j]; 
  }
}
</pre>
Numpy gives the best of both worlds: operations speedily executed by pre-compiled C code but with the code simplicity of something based on Python. This is known as <b>vectorization</b>, meaning the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc. in the code (or more accurately, the looping, etc. are taking place "behind the scenes" in optimized pre-compiled C code). 


<div class="subsection_title">Numpy Array Attributes</div>
A numpy <b>array</b>, also called an <code>ndarray</code>, is a multidimentional container of items of the same type and size. It is constructed using <code>array</code> and has the following attributes: 
<ul>
  <li><code>ndarray.ndim</code> outputs the dimension of the array</li>
  <li><code>ndarray.shape</code> returns the tuple describing the shape</li>
  <li><code>ndarray.size</code> returns the total number of elements in the array</li>
  <li><code>ndarray.dtype</code> describes the type of the elements in the array</li>
  <li><code>ndarray.itemsize</code> returns the amount of memory each element takes up, in Bytes</li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">

Numpy also supports arrays of complex numbers.

array([[ 1.+5.j,  2.+3.j],

</pre>
Furthermore, a 3-D array is shown as a stack of 2-D arrays. 
<pre class="terminal">

<div class="subsection_title">Numpy Array Creation</div>
Numpy arrays can be created with the following: 
<ul>
  <li><code>np.array</code> creates the array from an iterated list</li>
  <li><code>np.arange</code> creates a 1-D array with elements indexed from 0</li>
  <li><code>ndarray.reshape</code> reshapes the array to a specified shape</li>
  <li><code>np.zeros</code> creates an array of 0s</li>
  <li><code>np.ones</code> creates an array of 1s</li>
  <li><code>np.empty</code> creates an array of uninitialized values</li>
  <li><code>np.full</code> creates an array filled with one specified value</li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> np.array([[2, 3, 5], [-1, 8, 9]])
array([[ 2,  3,  5],

array([[[4.45057637e-308, 1.78021527e-306],
        [8.45549797e-307, 1.37962049e-306],
        [1.11260619e-306, 1.78010255e-306]],

>>> np.full((2, 3), 10, dtype=np.int32)
array([[10, 10, 10],
        [10, 10, 10]])
</pre>
Furthermore, the <code>np.arange</code> function can be used to make arrays containing general arithmetic sequences, and if the number of elements is known (but not the step size), we can use <code>np.linspace</code>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> from numpy import pi
>>> np.arange(10, 30, 5)
array([10, 15, 20, 25])
>>> np.arange(0, 2, 0.3)
array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8])
>>> np.linspace(0, 2, 9)
array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ])
>>> np.linspace(0, 2 * pi, 10)
array([0.        , 0.6981317 , 1.3962634 , 2.0943951 , 2.7925268 ,

</pre>
To get an array of random numbers, we use the following functions 
<ul>
  <li><code>np.random.rand(d1, d2, ...)</code> returns an array with elements picked randomly from a uniform distribution over $[0, 1)$, with the shape as its parameter. </li>
  <li><code>np.random.randint (low, high, shape)</code> returns an array of <code>shape</code> with elements as integers chosen randomly between <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> np.random.rand()
0.9137870621759168
>>> np.random.rand(3, 2)
array([[0.40222644, 0.63487523],
        [0.03923849, 0.17318991],
        [0.25070361, 0.42871893]])
>>> np.random.randint(3, 10, (3, 3))
array([[3, 7, 3],
       [5, 3, 8],
       [6, 3, 8]])
</pre>

Finally, the null value is created with <code>np.nan</code>, which outputs <code>NaN</code>. This can be thought of as an undefined or missing value. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> np.nan
nan
</pre>

<div class="subsection_title">Numpy Array Indexing, Slicing & Stacking</div>
Indexing and slicing arrays can be done as follows. 
<ul>
  <li>Indexing a 2-dimensional <code>ndarray</code> is like indexing the elements of a matrix: row first, then column (according to the shape)</li>
  <li>Since the 2-D array is like an iterated list, the first index iterates over the rows, and the second index iterates over the elements in each row. </li>
  <li><b>Slicing</b> an array can produce views, or cross-sections, of the array, and one can change elements of the array by setting it equal to a new number. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> x = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
>>> x
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
>>> x[2,3]
11
>>> x[0]
array([0, 1, 2, 3])
>>> x[:, 0]
array([0, 4, 8])
>>> x[-1]
array([ 8,  9, 10, 11])
</pre>
Arrays can be stacked and split along different axes. 
<ul>
  <li><code>np.vstack((a, b))</code> stacks array <code>b</code> below <code>a</code> vertically. </li>
  <li><code>np.hstack((a, b))</code> stacks array <code>b</code> to the right of <code>a</code> horizontally. </li>
  <li><code>hsplit</code> splits an array along its horizontal axis, either by specifying the number of equally shaped arrays to return or by specifying the columns after which the division should occur. </li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code> does exactly the same, except along its vertical axis. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">

<div class="subsection_title">Numpy Array Copying</div>
There are three cases: 
<ul>
  <li>No copy is made, since simple assignments of data make no copies of objects or their data. In this case, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> point to the same object.

  <li><b>View or shallow copies</b> represent the case when different array objects share the same data. The <code>view</code> method creates a new array object that looks at the same data (as shown in <code>base</code>). Note that changing the shape of a view copy does not affect the data nor the original copy, but changing the value of an element in a view copy does affect the base data and therefore affects the original copy.

>>> a = np.arange(6)
>>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
>>> c = np.arange(1000).reshape(10, 10, 10)
>>> np.savez("filename.npz", list1 = a, list2 = b, list3 = c)
>>> npzfile = np.load("filename.npz")
>>> npzfile.files
['list1', 'list2', 'list3']
>>> npzfile['list1']
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> npzfile['list2']
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])

We can create a pandas <b>Series</b> by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index. We import numpy to define the null value. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])
>>> s
0    1.0

<div class="subsection_title">Pandas DataFrame Creation & Indexing</div>
A pandas <b>DataFrame</b> is a 2-D labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types (in contrast to a 2-D ndarray, which must have <i>all</i> elements of all columns of the same type). There are multiple ways to create a pandas <b>DataFrame</b>, but they are all called through the command <code>pd.DataFrame(data, ...)</code>. 
<ul>
  <li>We can pass a 2-D Numpy array, with the index and columns labeled. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
          A         B         C         D

4 -1.284994  0.127667  0.074262 -1.003211
5 -0.401853  1.686010 -0.287202  0.663701
6 -1.123393  0.375613  1.478878  0.586513
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>We can create one using a list of lists. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> data = [['tom', 10], ['nick', 15], ['juli', 14]]
>>> pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Name', 'Age'])
   Name  Age
0   tom   10
1  nick   15
2  juli   14
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, we can create one using a dictionary. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> data = {"AAA": [4, 5, 6, 7], "BBB": [10, 20, 30, 40], "CCC": [100, 50, -30, -50]}
>>> pd.DataFrame(data, index = ['Day 1', 'Day 2', 'Day 3', 'Day 4'])
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
There are some useful functions when it comes to indexing. 
<ul>
  <li>We can treat the dictionary like an iterated list when indexing, with the first index refrencing the column and the second referencing the element in the column. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> df
        AAA  BBB  CCC

</pre>
  </li>

<div class="subsection_title">Adding, Deleting, Changing Elements in DataFrames</div>
In a DataFrame, we can change a single element, a row, or a column using either labels or by position by setting whatever element, row, or column equal to a new value. We show an example using labels but the process for position is identical using <code>iloc</code>.

To delete rows and columns (for elements, we can just set them to <code>NaN</code>), we use the <code>drop</code> function. Note that the drop function removes columns and rows based on labels rather than positioning. 
<ul>
  <li>To delete a column, we input in a list of the column labels and set parameter <code>axis=1</code>. </li>
  <li>To delete a row, we input in a list of the row labels and set parameter <code>axis=0</code>. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> df2, df3 = df.copy(), df.copy()
>>> df2.drop(['AAA', 'CCC'], axis=1)
         BBB
Day 1  999.0
Day 2    NaN
Day 3   30.0
Day 4   40.0
Day 5   50.0

To add two dataframes together with the same column but with additional indices (rows), we use the <code>concat()</code> function. 
<pre class="terminal">

      "B": ["B0", "B1", "B2", "B3"],

<div class="subsection_title">Copying, Saving, Loading Pandas DataFrames</div>
Copying a DataFrame is very simple using the <code>df.copy()</code>. By default, the only parameter <code>deep</code> is set to <code>True</code>, allowing us to create a deep copy of <code>pd</code>, and setting <code>deep=False</code> makes a shallow copy. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> df
       AAA    BBB  CCC
Day 1  1.0  999.0  1.0
Day 2  NaN    NaN  0.0
Day 3  1.0   30.0  1.0
>>> df2 = df.copy()
>>> df2
       AAA    BBB  CCC

Day 2  NaN    NaN  0.0
Day 3  1.0   30.0  1.0

To save a pandas dataframe to a file, we use the the following. Assume that <code>df</code> is a dataframe and <code>encoding='utf8'</code> should be set to avoid any character issues. 
<ul>
  <li><code>df.to_csv("filename.csv", index, encoding='utf8')</code> saves the data to a <code>csv</code> saves the file to <code>filename.csv</code> (path can also be specified here). Setting <code>index=False</code> does not save the row numbers in the output file, and setting <code>index=True</code> does. </li>
  <li><code>df.to_excel("filename.csv", index, encoding='utf8')</code> also saves the data to a <code>.xlsx</code> file, with the same parameters. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="terminal">
>>> df
       AAA    BBB  CCC
Day 1  1.0  999.0  1.0
Day 2  NaN    NaN  0.0
Day 3  1.0   30.0  1.0
>>> df.to_csv("output_filename.csv", index=False, encoding='utf8')
</pre>
To load the data in a certain file, we simply use the <code>read_csv</code> command. 
<pre class="terminal">
>>> data = pd.read_csv("path_to_filename.csv")

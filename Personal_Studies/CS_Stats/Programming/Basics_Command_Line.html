<h4>Non-Volatile Drive Storage</h4>
A <b>drive</b> is basically a computer component used to store data. It may be a static storage device (e.g. a HDD or SSD) or may use removable media (e.g. thumb, disk, CD). All drives store <b>nonvolatile data</b> (also called nonvolatile memory, NVM), meaning that the data is not erased when the power is turned off.

<ul>
  <li>A <b>floppy disk drive</b> is a portable circular floppy plastic/metal disk coated with iron oxide or other magnetic material. They come in many sizes ranging from 3~8 inches in diameter, with the standard capacity being 1.44MB. When inserting the floppy disk into a computer, there is a read/write head that uses a magnet to polarize the iron particles in one of two directions, each represting a 0 or 1 in binary data. The head can also read these polarities in order to retrieve data stored on the disk in the form of polarized particles. Note that the head would read the disk "circularly" as the disk rotates. Each disk would be divided into typically 40 tracks with around 8 equal sectors.</li>
  <li>A <b>hard disk drive (HDD)</b> is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid (hence, the name hard) rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. Data is accessed in arandom-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. They usually come inside a metal case enclosing the entire drive (3.5-inch for computers and 2.5-inch for laptop HDDs). Since the data on the HDD is determined by the polarities of the magnetic material on the disks, it is sensitive to external magnetic fields that may corrupt the data. Furthermore, because the drive heads must align over an area of the disk in order to read or write data, and the disk is constantly spinning, there’s a delay before data can be accessed. The drive may need to read from multiple locations in order to launch a program or load a file, which means it may haveto wait for the platters to spin into the proper position multiple times before it can complete the command. If a drive is asleep or in a low-power state, it can take several seconds more for the disk to spin up to full power and begin operating. Their speeds are measured in RPM, with the normal range of desktop HDDs having 5400-7200 RPM. It is useful to know that 5400 RPM drives offer an average of 100MB/s read and 7200 RPM drives offer 120MB/s.</li>
  <li>A <b>Solid State Drive (SSD)</b> is an extra step up from the HDD. From the very beginning, it was clear that hard drives couldn’t possibly match the speeds at which CPUs could operate. Latency in HDDs is measured in milliseconds, compared with nanoseconds for your typical CPU. One millisecond is 1,000,000 nanoseconds, and it typically takes a hard drive 10-15 milliseconds to find data on the drive and begin reading it. The hard drive industry introduced smaller platters, on-disk memory caches, and faster spindle speeds to counteract this trend, but there’s only so fast drives can spin. Western Digital’s 10,000 RPM VelociRaptor family is the fastest set of drives ever built for the consumer market, while some enterprise drives spun as quickly as 15,000 RPM. The problem is, even the fastest spinning drive with the largest caches and smallest platters are still achingly slow as far as your CPU is concerned.
  Unlike HDDs, soid state drives do not need moving parts or spinning disks (hence their name). Instead, it uses NAND flash memory, which is a type of non-volatile storage that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the Byte level. It also retains data for decades, regardless of whether the device is powered on or off. It is used in not only SSD, but also USB flash drives, SD cards, mobile phones, digital cameras, tablets, and others. 
  The most fundamental unit of storage is the flash memory cell, which uses electron thresholds to hold certain bits of information, usually three bits (called TLC - triple level cell) or four bits (called QLC - quad level cell). If is no electron charge in the cell, the cell represents a 111 (for TLC) and 1111 (for QLC). Since each cell can store multiple bits of information, they are arranged in a large array (consisting of millions of cells stacked on top of each other) into a block, leading to a typical storage between 256KB and 4MB.</li>
</ul>

Furthermore, each type of drive on a computer are assigned a <b>device/drive letter</b>, a single alphabetic character A through Z. 
Computers containing a hard drive always have that default hard drive assigned to a C: drive letter, and external drives may be assigned
different letters, such as Google Drive being assigned a G: drive letter. 
You may also notice that when opening the command prompt on windows, the leftmost letter represents which drive you are currently on. Note that the "wmic" is an abbreviation of Windows Management Interface Command. Some commands may require you to use an <b>elevated command prompt</b>, which can be used by opening the cmd file as an administrator.

<h4>Volatile, Short-Term Storage</h4>
Information travels from drives and other stores to the CPU, but the physical distance that the bits must travel across the motherboard also puts an upper limit on the retrieval speed (i.e. the speed of electromagnetic waves), especially if the distance must be covered thousands or millions of times back and forth. This limit is known as <b>latency</b>. This is why computers have a hierarchy of stores reserved for information that is accessed more frequently, some closer to the CPU and others even within the CPU itself!

<ul>
  <li><b>Random Access Memory</b>, or <b>RAM</b>, is short-term memory that acts as a cache for the CPU that is 50-200 times faster than a regular SSD. It is volatile, meaning that all its memory is erased when the computer shuts down. The most recent type of RAM is DDR4, then DDR3, followed by DDR2, DDR, and SDRAM. In addition the speeds of RAM is
    <ul>
      <li>DDR4: 2133mhz, 2400mhz, 2666mhz, 3200mhz</li>
      <li>DDR3: 1066mhz, 1300mhz, 1600mhz, 1866mhz</li>
    </ul>
    where the mhz value represents how many times per second the RAM can access its memory. However, know that some motherboards have technical limitations to what kind of RAM speed it can handle, so in these cases, the system will throttle your faster RAM stick to meet this need. 
    In terms of capacity, the following gives us nice benchmarks. 
    <ul>
      <li>4-8 GB: Laptops for web browsing and light gaming (e.g. my Macbook Air 2019)</li>
      <li>16-32 GB: Laptops for gaming (possibly heavy) and programming</li>
      <li>64-128 GB: Crazy stuff. </li>
      <li>256 GB: This basically means you have a RAM that is pretty much the size of a typical SSD. </li>
    </ul>
  Finally, there are broad categories of RAM. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Static RAM (SRAM)</b> requires a constant power flow in order to function and therefore doesn't need to be refreshed to keep the data intact (hence the name static). Note that this does not mean that SRAM is nonvolatile. Therefore, the SRAM is typically used in CPU caches or video cards. </li>
    <li><b>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</b> requires a periodic refresh of power in order to function. The capacitors that store data in DRAM gradually discharge energy (no energy means the data becomes lost). DRAM is found in systems memory and video graphics memory.</li>
    <li><b>Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM)</b> is a DRAM that operates in sync with the CPU clock, which means that it waits for the clock signal before responding to data input. This is advantageous since the CPU can process overlapping instructions in parallel, known as <b>pipelining</b> (the ability to reveive an instruction before the previous instruction has been fully resolved). This allows more instructions to be completed simultaneously. By contrast, DRAM is asynchronous, which means it responsd immediately to user input. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>CPU caches</b> have a hierarchy that is divided into (from fastest to slowest) L1, L2, L3, and sometimes even L4. The CPU will check the L1 cache first to see if there is a hit (if there is, then data is retrieved extremely fast), then the L2, and so on. 
    <ul>
      <li>L1: 8-64 KB storage typically (but there are exceptions, i.e. the Apple M1 chip has a 192 KB L1 cache) </li>
      <li>L2: 256KB-8MB storage</li>
      <li>L3: 10-64MB storage (and sometimes up to 256MB for server chips)</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

For my computer, the outputs are as such. It shows two memory sticks each with 8GB of memory, a memory type of 0 which is a DDR4 (type 24 means DDR3), speeds of 3200 mhz, and TypeDetail of 128 which means the RAM is synchronous (SDRAM).

<div id="section_content_2">
First, we review some definitions. More on program lifecycle phases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_lifecycle_phase" target=BLANK>here</a>. 
<ul>
  <li>Programming languages are broadly classified into two types. <b>High-level languages</b> are the familiar programming languages that we work with today (that allow much more abstraction), while <b>low-level languages</b> are very close to the hardware, such as machine language and assembly language. </li> <br>
  <li>Programmers write programs in <b>source code</b> (usually high-level languages), which are then inputted into <b>language processors</b> that translate them into <b>object code</b> (usually <b>machine code</b> consisting of binary). The duration in which the source code of the program is being edited is called the <b>edit time</b>, while the <b>compile time</b> is when the source code is translated into machine code by a language processor. There are three types of language processors. 
  <ul>
    <li>A <b>compiler</b> is a language processor that reads the complete source program written in high-level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language. The source code is translated to object code successfully if it is free of errors. The compiler specifies the errors at the end of the compilation with line numbers when there are any errors in the source code. The errors must be removed before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code again. (e.g. C, C++, C#, Java)</li>
    <li>An <b>assmebler</b> is used to translate the program written in <b>Assembly language</b> (basically a low-level language with very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the machine code instructions) into machine code. The assembler is basically the 1st interface that is able to communicate humans with the machine. We need an assembler to fill the gap between human and machine so that they can communicate with each other. Code written in assembly language is some sort of mnemonics (instructions) like ADD, MUL, MUX, SUB, DIV, MOV and so on, and the assembler is basically able to convert these mnemonics into binary code. </li>
    <li>An <b>interpreter</b> translates a single statement of the source program into machine code and executes immediately before moving on to the next line. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates its translating at that statement and displays an error message. The interpreter moves on to the next line for execution only after the removal of the error. An interpreter directly executes instructions written source code without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. (e.g. Python, Pearl, JavaScript, Ruby)</li>
  </ul>
  A quick compare and contrast. 
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Compiler</th>
      <th>Interpreter</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Takes more time to analyze source code but execution time is faster. </td>
      <td>Takes less time to analyze source code but execution time is slower. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Debugging is harder since compiler generates error message after entire scan. </td>
      <td>Debugging is easier since interpreter continues translating the program until error is met. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Requires a lot of memory for generating object codes. </td>
      <td>Requires less memory because no object code is generated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Generates intermediate object code. </td>
      <td>No intermediate object code is generated. </td>
    </tr>
  </table></li><br>
  <li>
    The result of a successful compilation is an executable, which is a program in the form of a file containing millions of lines of very simple machine code instructions (e.g. add 2 numbers or compare 2 numbers), also called <b>processor instructions</b>. This executable can be stored somewhere in the computer drive for future use or it may be copied immediately in a faster memory state, such as the RAM. The <b>load time</b> is when the OS takes the program's executable from storage and puts it into an active memory (e.g. RAM) in order to begin execution. 
    <br><br>
    The CPU understands only a low level machine code language (aka native code), which is contained within the executable. The language of the machine code is hardwired into the design of the CPU hardware; it is not something that can be changed at will. Each family of compatible CPUs (e.g. the popular Intel x86 family) has its own, idiosyncratic machine code which is not compatible with the machine code of other CPU families. More information <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/software-1.html" target=BLANK>here</a>. 
    <br><br>
    Once the instruction bytes are copied from storage to RAM, the CPU can run through the steps/lines at the rate of about 2 billion lines/steps per second. This execution phase, when the CPU executes the instructions until normal termination or a crash, is called the <b>runtime</b>. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>More on Executables</h4>
More specifically, an <b>executable</b> is a file that contains a list of instructions and data to cause a computer's CPU to perform indicated tasks, as opposed to the data files, which are fundamentally strings of data that must be interpreted (parsed) by a program to be meaningful. Executables usually have extension names <code>.exe</code> or <code>.bat</code>, and they can generally be run (invoked) in two ways: 
<ul>
  <li>The executable file can be run by simply double clicking on the file name, opening it, and having the user type commands in an interactive session of an interpter (like inputting commands in terminal window or a python shell).</li>
  <li>Alternatively, we can start writing a program, complete writing it, and then have this program compiled into an executable to be invoked. </li>
</ul>
Some common examples of executables are: 
<ul>
  <li>python.exe - used to run python scripts that have the .py extension, located at <code>C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39</code></li> 
  <li>pythonw.exe - used to run .pyw files for GUI programs</li> 
  <li>terminal.exe (on MacOS)</li>
  <li>cmd.exe (on Windows OS)</li>
  <li>py.exe - an exuecutable used to run the python.exe executable like a shortcut, located at <code>C:\windows\py.exe</code></li> 
</ul>

When your device connects to a router in a LAN, it has a local IP address (usually starting with <code>172.30.</code> or <code>192.168.</code>). Packets of data leaves your comptuer address, from a <b>port</b> (out of the 2<sup>16</sup>=65,536 ports), to the router local IP address, known as the <b>default gateway</b>. This router then connects to the internet, which now has another address (which can be Googled) and forwards the packets through there.

When in an environment (whether it'd be a base or a virtual one), the environment has certain characteristics that are stored in what we call the <b>environment variables</b>. A list of then can be outputted with the commands below. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows CMD</th> 
    <th>MacOS Terminal</th>
    <th>Task</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>set</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Lists all the environment variables</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %&lt;VARIABLE&gt;%</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Returns the value of the environment variable</td>
  </tr>
</table>
A few of the first variables that are outputted on my system is shown here. 
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>set
ALLUSERSPROFILE=C:\ProgramData
APPDATA=C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Roaming
CommonProgramFiles=C:\Program Files\Common Files
CommonProgramFiles(x86)=C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files
CommonProgramW6432=C:\Program Files\Common Files
</pre>
They are all in the form 
<pre>
   NAME=VALUE
</pre>
where the NAMEs are conventionally written in uppercase (<code>&VARIABLE</code> for MacOS and <code>%VARIABLE%</code> for Windows), and the VALUEs are strings. The point of these variables is to communicated to programs how the machine is set up and sometimes to control the behavior of programs (e.g. where the home directory is, what user is logged in, etc.). 

One notable environment variable is the <b>PATH environment variable</b>, which is basically a set of directories where executable programs are located. More specifically, it specifies the directories in which executable programs are located on the machine that can be started without knowing and typing the whole path to the file on the command line. Note that the shell does not check subdirectories in PATH, only that directory itself. We can also modify which file extensions (other than the common <code>.exe</code>, <code>.bat</code>, etc.) is supported by editing <code>%PATHEXT%</code>. One can check this this set of directories with the following commands: 
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows CMD</th> 
    <th>MacOS Terminal</th>
    <th>Task</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %PATH%</td>
    <td>echo $PATH</td>
    <td>Specifies the directories in which executables are located on the machine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>echo %PATHEXT%</td>
    <td>echo $PATHEXT</td>
    <td>Specifies the extensions that are supported by PATH and can therefore be called directly in cmd/terminal. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, calling <code>echo %PATHEXT%</code> on my Windows laptop returns the following supported executable extensions: </p>
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>echo %PATHEXT%
.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC
</pre>
<p>On MacOS, PATH usually holds all <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code> directories relevant for the current user. On Windows, it contains at least the <code>C:\Windows</code> and <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> directories. This is why you can run <code>calc.exe</code> or <code>notepad.exe</code> from the command line (you actually don't need to include the <code>.exe</code>, just <code>calc</code> will do), but not <code>chrome.exe</code> since it is located in <code>C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application</code>. <br>

Calling the PATH environment variable on my computer returns
<pre class="terminal">
C:\Users\bahng>echo %PATH%
C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common;C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA NvDLISR;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\mingw-w64\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\usr\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Library\bin;C:\Users\bahng\anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39;C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts
</pre>
and since I have <code>py.exe</code> installed in <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> (which is in PATH), I can call it immediately in cmd. However, the python.exe is located in <code>C:\Users\bahng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39</code>, which is currently not on the PATH variable and therefore cannot be called without specifying the <i>entire</i> path of <code>python.exe</code>. For convenience, we should modify the PATH variable to include the directory that <code>python.exe</code> is located in. Adding a directory to your PATH expands the # of directories that are searched when, from any directory, you enter a command in the shell. Unfortunately, modifying the PATH with the shell can be very dangerous, but there is an easy way to do it using a GUI explained very well through this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho" target="_blank">link</a>. All environment variables can be changed as explained in the link using the GUI (in the control panel).

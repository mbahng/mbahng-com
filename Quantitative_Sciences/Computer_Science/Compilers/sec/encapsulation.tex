\section{Encapsulation}

  % beginning of properties and relationships between classes. 

  \begin{definition}[Encapsulation] 
    % property 
    The result of hiding a representation and implementation in an object. The representation is not visible and cannot be accessed directly from outside the object. Operations are the only way to access and modify an object's representation.  
  \end{definition} 

  public, private, protected + getter/setter methods 
  Python doesn't have (true) encapsulation (or some people say it does, but it lacks access control), since the attributes can be accessed, even when there is name mangling.

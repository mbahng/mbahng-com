This is not a ``usual'' course on Python, and it is \textit{certainly} not an introductory course on Python. After coding in Python for about 4 to 5 years, I realized that my coding practices have not changed, and I should try to grow on them. These notes have four purposes. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Learn some intermediate Python through different syntax, methods, and classes. 
  \item Learn how Python and its data structures are implemented, specifically CPython (C notes are previously done). 
  \item Establish best practices by going through different case studies of codebase design. 
  \item Learn the APIs of some broad Python packages, mostly in the standard library that are pretty up in the dependency tree. 
\end{enumerate}

The vast majority of these details will not be covered in a standard computer science course. I learned them either through self-study or by coding (for projects or research).

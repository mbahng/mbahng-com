Clustering and dimensionality reduction is used for many purposes, such as preprocessing data, visualizing it, or encoding it in a sparser, more efficient way. Sometimes they are used synonymously because in the backened, many dimensionality reduction algorithms use some form of clustering, so I also group them together. 

In the clustering problem, we are given a training set of \textit{unlabeled} data
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D} = \{ \mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \mathbf{x}^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(n)}\}
\end{equation}

and want to group the data into a few cohesive clusters.

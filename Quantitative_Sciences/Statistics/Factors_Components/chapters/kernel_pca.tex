\section{Kernel PCA}

  \begin{definition}[Kernel PCA]
    Let $N_i$ be the neighborhood around $X_i$. Then, we want to find a mapping $W: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes 
    \begin{equation}
      \min_{W} \sum_{i=1}^n \bigg| \bigg| X_i - \sum_{j \in N_i} W_{ij} X_j \bigg| \bigg|^2 \text{ where } \sum_{j} W_{ij} = 1
    \end{equation}
    We can constrain the weights in $W$ so that anything that is not in the neighborhoods are $0$. 
  \end{definition}

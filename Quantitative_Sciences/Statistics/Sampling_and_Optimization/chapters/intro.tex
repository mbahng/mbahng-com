A series of notes on high-dimensional posterior sampling, optimization, and numerical integration methods. These are all used broadly within data science to approximate some distribution/value or simulate some evolution of a system. I've learned about these pretty much all at once, and there are many overlaps in these methods, so I wrote all of them in one set of notes.

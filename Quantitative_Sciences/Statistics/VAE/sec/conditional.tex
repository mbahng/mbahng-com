\section{Conditional VAEs}

  Note that once our VAE is trained, we have no control on the data generation process. That is, if we want to generate only the digit 2, we can't since we must just sample from the Gaussian $p(z)$ in the latent space. Therefore, conditioning all the distributions on what we want is the objective of \textit{conditional VAEs}, which uses the \textit{conditional ELBO}. 

  \begin{definition}[Conditional ELBO]
    The \textbf{conditional ELBO} of $x, \theta, \phi$ given some conditioning vector $c$\footnote{Analogous to the digit we want in MNIST.}, is defined 
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z \mid x)} \big[ \log p_\theta(x \mid z,c) - \mathrm{KL}(q_\phi (z \mid x,c) || p(z \mid c)) \big] 
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}

# Contribution 

   Recursive PCA requires all historical observations and complete recalculation of parameters at each time point. A more efficient updating approach was proposed here, which provided more detailed treatment of basic approach to mean and covariance/correlation updating. This founded the faster methods used in modern literature. 

   A new observation is evaluated when obtained. If $T^2$ or $Q$ statistics exceed the limits because observation is a fault or outlier, then model is not updated. Otherwise it is. Inspired also by a recursive version of PLS by Dayal (1997).

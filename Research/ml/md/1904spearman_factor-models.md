# Contribution
   
   First instance of factor models. 

# Background 

   He thinks psychology is getting trashed on too hard since all experimental (the new psych) discoveries have been pretty trivial, and the non-trivial ones are too hard to approach with anything but introspection (the old way, aka individual psychology). 

   Therefore, he creates a mathematical model that correlates general intelligence (IQ) with performance in specific activities. Inspired by a previous account (but not systematic analysis) by Galton in 1883, he wants to know what connects these talents and coins the term correlational psychology. 

   The meat of this paper is in chapter 4. 

   Finally, he talks about how some of these findings might conflict with previous works. 


# Experiments 

   Basically want to see how intelligence correlates with sensory skills. Took samples of school children in a local neighborhood. 
   1. The sensory skills are in touch, sound, sight. They are given slightly changing inputs, e.g. cards with gradually varying colors, or textures 
   2. The intelligence is divided into 4 types. School ranking, school ranking normalized for age (rank minus age), general impression, common sense. 

# Correlational Analysis

   Inspired by Pearson's work. Takes the correlation (plus mean and some other modifications of correlation) between the intelligence (input) and sensory skills (output). There is no matrix theory here, and all he does is take all pairwise combination of correlations. There are 4 experiments that analyze a subset of them. We will only explain the first experiment here. 
   
   We have 3 types of intelligence and 3 types of visual sensory data (how good one is at discriminating between colors, touch, sound). There are 9 correlations in total. 
   1. All of them are positive correlation. 
   2. About half of them under $0.09$, and as for the rest, the smallest is 0.25 with an average of 0.38 (with error of 0.02, which is very statistically significant). 
   3. They also talk about how different forms of intelligence have strong correlation (up to 0.84) and so they coincide quite a bit.  
   4. Age has a strong correlation overall with intelligence. 

   Overall he just keeps saying some observations and qualitatively tries to explain this. There are many other factors that he models, such as performance in school subjects.

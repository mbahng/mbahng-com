# Contribution 

   Thurstone presents a general linear factor model that we are familiar with today, with the loading matrix. 

# Background 

   Spearman's modeling is too specific because given some factors $f$ and tasks $x$, Spearman assumed that there was one common factor $g$ along with several specific factors that contributed to performance. Rather, it is perhaps the case that every factor has some influence, so we want to model the performance in every task with *all* factors.

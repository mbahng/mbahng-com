# Contribution 

   Gives a MLE method of estimating the parameters of a factor model, which can then be estimated by iteration. Also summarizes previous works on comparing PCA and factor analysis. 

# Method 

   A factor model can be trivially solved if the number of factors $p$ is sufficiently large, but if not, then we must do a hypothesis test. 

   However, convergence is slow and may not always optimize. Therefore, better methods are suggested.

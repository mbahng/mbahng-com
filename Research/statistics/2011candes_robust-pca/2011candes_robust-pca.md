   shown in Wright that under some conditions, it is possible to exactly recover the low-rank and sparse components with high probability and that the choice of $\lambda = 1/ \sqrt{\max (n, m)}$ works well in a general setting, avoiding the need to choose a tuning parameter. 
   
   Results are extended to the case of data matrices with missing values. Algorithms for the identification of the components are discussed, an important issue given the computational complexity involved.

   Given the loss

   they consider other variations where the noise component has a more complex structure. The results of alternative algorithms in presence of different types of noise are compared to the context of image processing and facial recognition problems. Their results show that classical PCA performs fairly well, when compared with these new methods, in terms of both time and quality of low-rank solutions that are produced.

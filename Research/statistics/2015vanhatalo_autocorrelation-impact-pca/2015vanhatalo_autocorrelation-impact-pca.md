   Yes, this is recent but it tells the impact of autocorrelation for static PCA, which should motivate Ku's paper. Creates a VAR(1) model, plots the scatterplot, and shows that if there is autocorrelation, the principal components are not good estimators of the true generating process (unless the Phi is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements the same, then this is just scaled version and structure is preserved).

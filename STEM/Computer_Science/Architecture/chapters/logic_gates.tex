\section{Logic Gates}

  For a refresher, the logic gates are listed here. 

\subsection{Hardware Description Languages (HDL)}

  Clearly, engineers don't probably spend their days endlessly drawing little gates on paper. We use specific software---called hardware description language (HDL)---to model and design these digital systems. Historically, \textit{Verilog} was the most dominant, but it has been largely replaced by \textit{SystemVerilog} and \textit{VHDL}.

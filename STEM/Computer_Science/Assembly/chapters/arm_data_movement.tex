\section{ARM Data Movement} 

  At this point (assuming you are going through my computer science notes in order), we have encountered our first lexical computer language. We aren't just describing things with psuedocode like we did with architecture, and we aren't relying on hardware-like systems like circuits or Conway's game of life here. This extra level of abstraction is nice to work with, but in order to fully appreciate it, we must know how to convert assembly into machine code. As we have seen, this is done in two steps. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Assemblers} convert them into object files. 
    \item \textit{Linkers} use a relocation table to convert them into executables, written in machine code. 
  \end{enumerate} 
  This is essentially a translation from one language into another, and to do this, we might want to have some organization in our code. Therefore, we divide \texttt{.s} files into \textit{sections}. Furthermore, we might want to include instructions that tell the assembler---not the CPU---how to process your code, analogous to preprocessing text or tuning parameters for translation. 

  Both sections and directives have a period \texttt{.} at the front of their name, so you must tell them apart by context. 

  \begin{definition}[Section]
    In order for assemblers and linkers to interpret your programs, we must organize them into \textbf{sections}. Each section---specified by the distinctive \texttt{.} at the front of its name---specifies the following non-exhaustive list of properties. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The read/write/executable permissions. 
      \item How data is initialized. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition} 

  \begin{example}[Must-Know Sections]
    The main sections you should be familiar with are 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{.text} (read+execute). This is where you write your code. 
      \item \texttt{.data} (read+write). This is where you store data and memory. 
      \item \texttt{.rodata} (read). Stores constant data that should not be modified during program execution. 
      \item \texttt{.bss} (read+write). Zero-initialized and stores uninitialized variables. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example} 

  You can also create your own sections. 

\subsection{Loading}

  The first thing you should know about are registers. Here are the register conventions for ARM64. 

  \begin{definition}[ARM64 Registers]
    A 64-bit program on an ARM processor has access to 31-general purpose registers, a program counter, and a stack pointer (aka a combination zero register). 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{X0} - \texttt{X30}. These 31 registers are general purpose. You can use them for anything you want, though there are some standards. 
      \item \texttt{SP, XZR}. The link register. If you call a function, this register will be used to hold the return address. 
      \item \texttt{PC}. Program counter. The memory address of the currently executing instruction. 
    \end{enumerate}
    All the X registers can be operated on as 32-bit registers by referring to them as W0–W30 and WZR. When we do this, the instruction will use the lower 32 bits of the register and set the upper 32 bits to zero. Using 32 bits saves memory, since you only use 4 bytes rather than 8 bytes for each quantity saved. 
    Some Apple specific things: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Apple reserves X18 for its own use. Do not use this register. 
      \item The frame pointer register (\texttt{FP}, \texttt{X29}) must always address a valid frame record. This is for backtraces. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}

\subsection{Assembling and Disassembling} 

  \begin{definition}[Instruction Syntax]
    Every ARM instruction---regardless of whether we're in 32-bit or 64-bit ARM---can be fit into 32 bits of memory. The fixed-length variable of this is good for speed.   
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering 
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \textbf{31} & \textbf{30} & \textbf{29} & \textbf{28-24} & \textbf{23-22} & \textbf{21} & \textbf{20-16} & \textbf{15-10} & \textbf{9-5} & \textbf{4-0} \\
      \hline
      Bits & Opcode & Set Condition Code & Opcode & Shift & 0 & Rm & Imm & Rn & Rd \\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Instruction encoding format.} 
    \end{figure}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Bits}. If this bit is $0$, then any registers are interpreted as the 32-bit \texttt{W} version. If $1$, then they are the full 64-bit version of the register.\footnote{You cannot mix W and Z bits in the same instruction!}

      \item \textit{Opcode}. which instruction are we performing, e.g. \texttt{ADD} or \texttt{MUL}. 

      \item \textit{Shift}. These two bits specify shifting operations that could be applied to the data. 

      \item \textit{Set Condition Code}. A single bit indicating if this instruction should update any condition flags. If we don't want the result of this instruction to affect following branch instructions, we set it to $0$. 

      \item \textit{Rm, Rn}. Operand registers to use as input. 
        
      \item \textit{Rd}. Destination register, i.e. where to put the result of whatever this instruction does. 

      \item \textit{Imm6}. An immediate operand which is usually a small bit of data that you can specify directly in the instruction. So, if you want to add 1 to a register, you could have this as 1, rather than putting 1 in another register and adding the two registers. These are usually the bits left over after everything else is specified.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}

  A \textbf{dump} refers to a representation of the contents and structure of an object file or memory at a specific point in time. Once a file is assembled it's almost impossible to read. Fortunately, there are some nice shell commands to help us. 

  \begin{definition}[\texttt{objdump}]
    Taken from the man pages, the \textbf{objdump} utility prints the contents of object files and final linked images named on the command line. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{-d}, \texttt{--disassemble}. Disassemble all executable sections found in the input files. On some architectures (AArch64, PowerPC, x86), all known instructions are disassembled by default. 
      \item \texttt{-t}, \texttt{--syms}. Display the symbol table. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{example}[\texttt{objdump -d}]
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering 
      \begin{lstlisting}
        .text
          .globl _main
          _main:
              mov x0, #0x1
              b _exit
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{} 
    \end{figure}

        hello:  file format mach-o arm64

        Disassembly of section __TEXT,__text:

        00000001000003c0 <_main>:
        1000003c0: d2800020     mov     x0, #0x1                ; =1
        1000003c4: 14000001     b       0x1000003c8 <_exit+0x1000003c8>

        Disassembly of section __TEXT,__stubs:

        00000001000003c8 <__stubs>:
        1000003c8: 90000030     adrp    x16, 0x100004000 <_exit+0x100004000>

    The mov command has the hex command \texttt{d2800020}, which translates in binary to 
    \begin{lstlisting}
      1101 0010 1000 0000 0000 0000 0010 0000
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The first bit is 1, meaning use the 64-bit version of the registers, in this case X0 rather than W0.

      \item The third bit is 0, which means that this instruction doesn’t set any flags that would affect conditional instructions.

      \item The second bit combined with the fourth to ninth bits make up the opcode for this MOV instruction. This is move wide immediate, meaning it contains a 16-bit immediate value.

      \item The next 2 bits of 0 indicate there is no shift operation involved.

      \item The next 16 bits are the immediate value which is 1.

      \item The last 5 bits are the register to load. These are 0 since we are loading register X0.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}

\subsection{Directive}

  \begin{definition}[Directive]
    A \textbf{directive} is an instruction to the assembler. It tells the assembler how to process your code, but doesn't generate machine instructions, making it like commands for the assembler and not the CPU. 

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{example}[Symbol Control]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .globl _main       // Make symbol globally visible
      .local helper      // Keep symbol local to this file
      .extern _printf    // Reference external symbol
      .weak _optional    // Make symbol weakly defined
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Data Creation]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .byte 0x42         // Create 1-byte value
      .word 42           // Create 4-byte value  
      .quad 42           // Create 8-byte value
      .asciz "hello"     // Create null-terminated string
      .ascii "hello"     // Create string (no null terminator)
      .space 64          // Reserve 64 bytes of space
      .fill 10, 4, 0     // Fill 10 4-byte words with 0
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Alignment]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .align 4           // Align to 4-byte boundary
      .p2align 2         // Align to 2^2 = 4-byte boundary  
      .balign 16         // Align to 16-byte boundary
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Section Control]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .text              // Switch to code section
      .data              // Switch to data section
      .bss               // Switch to uninitialized data section
      .section my_custom // Create/switch to custom section
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Conditional Assembly]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .ifdef DEBUG
        .asciz "Debug build"
      .else  
        .asciz "Release build"
      .endif
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Macros]
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=assembly]
      .macro SAVE_REGS
        stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
        mov x29, sp
      .endm

      # Usage:
      _my_function:
        SAVE_REGS          // Expands to the macro content
        // ... function body
        ret
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[]
    \begin{lstlisting}
      
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}
    
    \begin{lstlisting}
      # DIRECTIVES (instructions to assembler):
      .globl _main        # "Make this symbol global"
      .align 4            # "Align the next thing to 4 bytes"
      .asciz "hello"      # "Create a null-terminated string here"

      # INSTRUCTIONS (actual CPU operations):
      mov x0, #42         # CPU instruction: move 42 into x0
      bl _printf          # CPU instruction: branch with link
      ret                 # CPU instruction: return 
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}


  You open up your text editor on an M1 Mac, and every assembly program should start with this. 

  \begin{lstlisting}
    .globl _main
    _main:
      ...
      b _exit
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  \texttt{.globl} is an assembler directive that makes the symbol \texttt{\_main} globally visible to the linker. This allows other files/modules to reference this \texttt{\_main} function. \texttt{b \_exit} is a specific function that tell the program to shut down.

\section{Flows and Cuts} 

\subsection{Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem} 

  \begin{definition}[Flow Network]
    Given a nonnegative weighted directed graph $G(V, E)$, we can define the weights to be the \textbf{capacity} $C: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ of some commodity that can travel through the edge. Say that we have a source node $s \in V$ and a sink/destination node $t \in V$. This is called a \textbf{flow network}.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Flow]
    Given a flow network, a \textbf{flow} is a function $f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ satisfying 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Conservation}. What flows in must always flow out. For all $v \neq s, t$, we have 
        \begin{equation}
          \sum_{(u \rightarrow v) \in E} f(u \rightarrow v) = \sum_{(v \rightarrow w) \in E} f(v \rightarrow w)
        \end{equation}

      \item \textit{Feasibility}. We cannot exceed the capacity. For all $e \in E$, 
        \begin{equation}
          0 \leq f(e) \leq C(e)
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
    The \textbf{value} of a flow represents the actual/realized amount of the commodity that we can push through the graph
    \begin{equation}
      |f| = \sum_{(s \rightarrow u) \in E}  f(s \rightarrow u) - \sum_{(u \rightarrow s) \in E}  f(u \rightarrow s) 
    \end{equation} 
    where we need to subtract the right expression to avoid loops. 
  \end{definition}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The red values represent the flow. The blue values represent the capacity. The value of the above flow is 10.} 
    \label{fig:flow}
  \end{figure}

  Now let's revisit cuts. 

  \begin{definition}[Cuts]
    Given a flow network, a s-t \textbf{cut} is a partition of $V = S \sqcup T$ s.t. $s \in S, t \in T$. The \textbf{value}, or \textbf{capacity}, of a cut is defined as the capacity of its edges 
    \begin{equation}
      ||S, T|| = \sum_{u in S} \sum_{v \in T} C(u \rightarrow v)
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering 
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        node distance=2.5cm,
        vertex/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=0.8cm},
        auto,
        >=Stealth
    ]

    % Nodes with increased horizontal spacing
    \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {s};
    \node[vertex] (a) at (3,2) {};
    \node[vertex] (b) at (6,2) {};
    \node[vertex] (c) at (3,-2) {};
    \node[vertex] (d) at (6,-2) {};
    \node[vertex] (t) at (9,0) {t};

    % Edges with upright colored fraction labels
    \draw[->] (s) -- node[above] {$\color{blue}20$} (a);
    \draw[->] (s) -- node[below] {$\color{blue}10$} (c);
    \draw[->] (a) -- node[above] {$\color{blue}5$} (b);
    \draw[->] (a) -- node[left] {$\color{blue}10$} (c);
    \draw[->] (b) -- node[above] {$\color{blue}15$} (t);
    \draw[->] (b) -- node[right] {$\color{blue}20$} (d);
    \draw[->] (c) -- node[below] {$\color{blue}10$} (d);
    \draw[->] (d) -- node[below] {$\color{blue}20$} (t);
    \draw[<-] (c) -- node[right] {$\color{blue}15$} (b);

    % Draw the cut (add this on background layer to appear behind nodes)
    \begin{scope}[on background layer]
        \draw[dashed, thick, gray] (4.5,-3) -- (4.5,3);
        
        % Add labels for the sets
        \node at (2,2.5) {S};
        \node at (7,2.5) {T};
    \end{scope}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{This cut has capacity 15. Note that the cut going from right to left is not included since this is a S-T cut. } 
    \label{fig:cut}
  \end{figure}

  We now introduce two related problems. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Max Flow. How do we find the flow with the maximum value? This is analogous to maximizing the commodity transport from $s$ to $t$.  
    \item Min Cut. How do we find the cut with the minimum capacity? This is analogous to removing the smallest total edges that will disconnect $s$ to $t$. 
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
    For any valid $(s, t)$ flow $f$ on a flow network $G = (V, E)$ and any valid $(s, t)$-cut $S, T$, we have 
    \begin{equation}
      |f| \leq ||S, T||
    \end{equation} 
    It also turns out that equality is achieved, which immediately implies that the max-flow is the min-cut. 
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    We can see that in order for a flow to have a value, given some cut the flow value cannot exceed the capacity through this cut from $S$ to $T$. Mathematically, we can see that the flow value is invariant due to conservation, and so  
    \begin{align}
      |f| & = \sum_{s \rightarrow v} f(s \rightarrow v) - \sum_{v \rightarrow s} f(v \rightarrow s) \\ 
          & = \sum_{u \in S} \sum_{v \in T} f(u \rightarrow v) - \sum_{v \in T} \sum_{u \in S} f(v \rightarrow u) \\ 
          & \leq \sum_{u \in S} \sum_{v \in T} c(u \rightarrow v) = ||S, T||
    \end{align}
    The fact that equality is achieved is highly nontrivial, and we will not cover it here. 
  \end{proof} 

\subsection{Maximum Flows}  

  Now to compute the maximum flow itself, we use a residual graph. For now, we will assume that a flow network $G$ does not have 2-cycles (cycles of length 2), and if we do find a graph with such a 2-cycle, we modify it by adding an intermediate node. 

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering 
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        vertex/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=0.6cm},
        >=Stealth
    ]

    % First pattern
    \node[vertex] (u1) at (0,0) {$u$};
    \node[vertex] (v1) at (2,0) {$v$};

    \draw[->] (u1) to[bend left=30] (v1);
    \draw[->] (v1) to[bend left=30] (u1);

    % Arrow indicating transformation
    \draw[-{Stealth[length=10pt]}, double] (3,0) -- (4,0);

    % Second pattern
    \node[vertex] (u2) at (5,0) {$u$};
    \node[vertex] (v2) at (7,0) {$v$};
    \node[vertex] (uv2) at (6,-1.5) {$uv$};

    \draw[->] (u2) -- (v2);
    \draw[->] (v2) -- (uv2);
    \draw[->] (uv2) -- (u2);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{How we modify our 2-cycle.} 
    \label{fig:cycle_mod}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{definition}[Residual Network]
    Given a flow network $G$ and a flow $f$, the \textbf{residual graph} $G_f$ is a new flow network that has edges $u \rightarrow v$ and $v \rightarrow u$, where 
    \begin{equation}
      c_f (u \rightarrow v) = \begin{cases} c (u \rightarrow v) - f(u \rightarrow v) & \text{ if } u \rightarrow v \in E \\ 
        f(u \rightarrow v) & \text{ if } v \rightarrow u \in E
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Basically, if there is some flow in an edge, we replace that edge's capacity by the residual capacity, giving us our \textit{forward edge}, and then take this flow and add it to a new opposite pointing edge, called the \textit{backwards edge}. 
  \end{definition} 

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering 
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        node distance=2.5cm,
        vertex/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=0.8cm},

    \node[vertex] (c) at (3,-2) {c};
    \node[vertex] (d) at (6,-2) {d};
    \node[vertex] (t) at (9,0) {t};

    \label{fig:residual_network}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{theorem}
    If we have a flow $f$, its value $|f|$ can be improved/augmented up to the bottleneck capacity on any residual path. That is, if we find any $s \rightarrow t$ path $\pi$ on $G_f$, with a positive bottleneck capacity (minimum capacity over its edges), we can improve the flow.\footnote{For example, the capacity of the path $S, C, A, B, T$ is $5$, since $A \rightarrow B$ has weight $5$.} Given this residual path $\pi$, it may have both forward or backwards edges. To augment the original path on $G$ by value $b$, we look at each edge $(u \rightarrow v) \in E$ and 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If it corresponds to a forward edge (i.e. if $(u \rightarrow v)$ is in the residual path $\pi$), we add $b$. This corresponds to how much more flow you can put into this edge. 
      \item If it corresponds to a backward edge (i.e. if $(v \rightarrow u)$ is in the residual path $\pi$), we subtract $b$. The corresponds to how much flow could you reroute in the backwards direction and have it reach $t$ through another path.   
      \item If it is not in $\pi$, then we don't change it. 
    \end{enumerate}
    In summary, the new flow $f^\prime$ is defined 
    \begin{equation}
      f^\prime (u \rightarrow v) = \begin{cases} 
        f(u \rightarrow v) + b & \text{ if } (u \rightarrow v) \in \pi \\ 
        f(u \rightarrow v) - b & \text{ if } (v \rightarrow u) \in \pi \\  
        f(u \rightarrow v) & \text{ else }
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem} 
  \begin{proof}
    We first show that $f^\prime$ is a valid flow. For feasibility, 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Forward}. If $(u \rightarrow  v) \in \pi$, then 
        \begin{equation}
          f^\prime (u \rightarrow v) = f(u \rightarrow v) + b \leq f(u \rightarrow v) + c_f (u \rightarrow v) = c(u \rightarrow v)
        \end{equation} 
      \item \textit{Backward}. If $(v \rightarrow u) \in \pi$, then 
        \begin{equation}
        f^\prime (u \rightarrow v) = f(u \rightarrow v) - b \geq f(u \rightarrow v) - c_f (v \rightarrow u) = 0 
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}

    For conservation, there are 4 cases. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Forward into node, forward out of node. $\Delta_{in} = +b, \Delta_{out} = +b$. Therefore the flows cancel out. 
      \item Forward into node, backward out of node. $\Delta_{in} = +b - b = 0$. 
      \item Backward into node, forward out of node. $\Delta_{out} = +b - b = 0$. 
      \item Backward into node, backward out of node. $\Delta_{in} = -b, \Delta_{out} = - b$. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof} 

  At this point, we're pretty much ready to give our algorithm on max-flow. 

  \begin{algo}[Ford-Fulkerson]
    We've reduced this problem to a problem of finding a positive path $\pi$ in the residual graph, which we have a lot of algorithms built for. We find such a path and augment the flow until we cannot find such a path. If we cannot find a path, then we can use BFS to look at all vertices $S \subset V$ reachable from $s$ in $G_f$, and then let $T = V \setminus S$. These two disjoint sets will give the min cut. 
    
    \begin{algorithm}[H]
      \label{alg:maxflow}
      \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require{Flow network $G(V, E)$, source/sink $s, t \in V$. Capacity $c$. }
        \State 
        \Function{MaxFlow}{G}
        \State Start with the trivial flow $f$, maybe stored as array $[0, \ldots, 0]$ of length $E$. 
          \State Construct residual graph $G_f$ for this trivial flow. 
          \While{$G_f$ has an augmenting path in $G_f$} \Comment{Maybe use BFS to find this.}
            \State Pick $\pi$ as any augmenting path 
            \State augment $f$ by bottleneck capacity 
            \State update $G_f$. 
          \EndWhile
          \State \Return{f}  
          \State Use BFS to find all nodes in $G_f$ reachable from $s$. Call this $S$.  
          \State Let $T = V \setminus S$.  
          \State $S, T$ is our min cut, and $f$ is your max flow. 
        \EndFunction
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}
    The inner loop is just BFS, which is $O(N + M)$, but how many iterations do we do? Well for integer capacities, we can bound it by the actual value of the max flow $|f^\ast|$ since we must improve by at least $+1$ every loop.\footnote{This is not a trivial result that if all capacities are integers, then there is an integer max-flow, despite the actual flow being dispersed as fractions across edges.} Unfortunately, $O((N+M) |f^\ast|)$ is the best we can do in generality, which is pseudopolynomial. 
  \end{algo}

  There are indeed polynomial time algorithms, e.g. Orlin's algorithm with runtime $O(NM)$, which is guaranteed to be polynomial but in practice may be slower.

    The idea is to reduce the maximum flow by first assigning capacity 1 to every edge. Then we compute the maximum flow $f^\ast$, and then return $|f^\ast|$. It turns out that even if we chose a path $\pi$ that went through the center node, the augmentation would push us to redirect the flows to the top and bottom outer edges. Since $|f^\ast| \leq n-1 < m$ in this example (since it can be at most the maximum indegree or outdegree of $s, t$), we should probably use Ford-Fulkerson rather than Orlin's algorithm. 
  \end{example}

  This leads to the lemma. 

  \begin{theorem}[Edge-Disjoint Paths]
    Given directed graph $G$ and its corresponding flow network $G^\prime$ of capacity $1$, the following are true: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If there exists $k$ edge-disjoint paths in $G$, then there exists a flow with value $\geq k$ in $G^\prime$. 
      \item If there exists a flow of value $k$ in $G^\prime$, then there exists $k$ edge-disjoint paths in $G$. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    The first is trivially feasible and conservation is satisfied since for any node $u \in V \setminus \{s, t\}$, every path in $P$ (the collection of $k$ paths) that enters $u$ must exit $u$, so the total flow in equals the total flow out $\implies$ $f$ is a valid $(s, t)$-flow. Therefore, we have $k$ paths leaving $s$, so $|f| = k$. 

    For the other direction, let $f$ be the flow with value $k$, and let $P = \{\}$. Let $H$ be the subgraph of $G^\prime$ of edges with positive flow, and for every loop, we use BFS from $s$ to $t$ to get a path $\pi$. We then add $\pi$ to $P$ and remove $\pi$ from $H$, repeat this $k$ times until we get $k$ paths in $P$.  
  \end{proof} 

  The way that we have constructed a collection of paths from a flow function is very useful, and is called \textit{flow decomposition}. We can go back and forth between a flow and a collection of paths by doing what we have just done in the previous proof. 

  \begin{definition}[Flow Decomposition]
    Given a general flow $f$ on flow network $G$, we initialize our set of paths $P = \{\}$ and loop the following: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Use BFS from $s$ to $t$ to get a path $\pi$. 
      \item Add $\pi$ to $P$ and rather than strictly removing the path from $H$, we need to be mindful of how much flow is left on it after removing only the bottleneck flow on the path. 
    \end{enumerate}
    This can be done in $O(NM)$ time, which loosely is because we are running BFS $O(M)$ times. 
  \end{definition}

  \begin{example}[Undirected Edge-Disjoint Paths]
    What if $G$ is undirected? In this case, we want to construct a flow network and then convert its 2 cycles into a 3 cycles by adding artificial points, taking linear time. 
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Undirected Edge-Disjoint Paths]
    Another problem is about vertex-disjoint paths, which is a stronger restriction than edge-disjoint ones. Each node does not have a concept of a capacity, so the general idea is for each vertex $v$, replace it with an ``in-out gadget'' with an edge of weight 1. The rest of the details follow similarly from edge-disjoint paths.

  \begin{example}[Maximum Bipartite Matching]
    Another application is in \textbf{bipartite matching}, which for an undirected bipartite graph $G(V, E)$ with $V = A \sqcup B$, is a subset of the edges $M \subset E$ s.t. no 2 edges in $M$ share an endpoint. The goal is to find the maximum bipartite matching, i.e. the matching with the greatest total weight.

    The general idea is to take an undirected graph, convert it to a flow network, compute the max flow, i.e. min cut, and then translate it back into the undirected graph solution.  
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Construct the flow network $G^\prime = (V^\prime, E^\prime)$, where $V^\prime = V \cup \{s, t\}$, with additional edges going from $s$ to $A$ and $B$ to $t$ all with weights $1$. Replace the middle edges with directed edges towards the flow with the same weight (though it can be any weight at least 1).

      \item Compute max flow $f$ in $G^\prime$. 
      \item Return $M = \{ (u \rightarrow v) \in E \mid f(u \rightarrow v) = 1 \}$. This can be done using the flow decomposition or just by looking at the edges in our flow with value $1$ and mapping it to the corresponding undirected bipartite graph. 
    \end{enumerate}
    To see correctness, we claim that there exists a matching $M$ in $G$ of size $k$ iff there exists a flow $f$ in $G^\prime$ with $|f|= k$, and therefore the max matching corresponds to the max flow. Constructing the flow network is $O(N + M)$ since $N^\prime = N + 2$ and $M^\prime = M + N$. Computing the max-flow is $O(N^\prime M^\prime)$ or $O(M^\prime |f|)$ depending on if we use Orlin's or Ford-Fulkerson, but either one is $O(NM)$. Then mapping it back to $M$ might take $O(M)$, so the total time is $O(NM)$.

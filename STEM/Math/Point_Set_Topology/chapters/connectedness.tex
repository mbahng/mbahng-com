\section{Connectedness} 

    We briefly define some weaker forms of separability. Note that a space being $t_2$-separable is the condition of being Hausdorff. 

    \begin{definition}[$t_0, t_1$-Separability]
    Two points $x_1, x_2 \in X$ with topology $\tau_{X}$ is called $t_0$\textbf{-separable} if we can distinguish $x_1, x_2$ using open sets, i.e. if we can find an open set that contains $x_1$, but not $x_2$. A space $X$ with the property that any two distinct points in $X$ being $t_0$-separable is called a $t_0$-separable space. This is the weakest form of separability. 

    The next level of separability is called $t_1$-separability. When given 2 distinct points $x_1, x_2$ in $t_1$-separable set $X$, we can find neighborhoods $U_{x_1}, U_{x_2}$ such that $U_{x_1} \neq U_{x_2}$. 
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{img/t0_t1_Separability.PNG}
    \end{center}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}
    $(0,1)$ with the nested interval topology is not $t_0$-separable, since we can't distinguish $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
    $(0,1)$ with the cofinite topology is $t_0$-separable, since given distinct $x_1, x_2 \in (0,1)$, we can see that $x_1 \in X \setminus {x_2}$ and $x_2 \in X \setminus {x_1}$, which are both elements of the cofinite topology. By existence of these elements, $(0,1)$ is $t_1$-separable. 
    \end{example}

  \subsection{Connected Spaces}

    \begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A \textbf{separation} of $X$ is a pair $U, V$ of disjoint nonempty open subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$. The space $X$ is said to be \textbf{connected} if there does not exist a separation of $X$. 

    The visual below shows two examples of spaces that are not connected. 
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{img/Not_Connected_Spaces_Examples.PNG}
    \end{center}
    \end{definition}

    Connectedness is clearly a topological property since it is completely defined in terms of the collection of open sets in $X$. Since homeomorphisms preserves topological properties, we can say that if $X$ is connected, every space homeomorphic to $X$ is also connected. It is easy to see why the following definition of connectedness is equivalent to the first one. 

    \begin{definition}
    A space $X$ is \textbf{connected} if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are clopen in $X$ are the empty set and $X$ itself. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
    If $Y$ is a subapce of $X$, a separation of $Y$ is a pair of disjoint nomempty sets $A$ and $B$ whose union is $Y$, neither of which contains a limit point of the other. The space $Y$ is connected if there exists no separation of $Y$. 
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{example}
    In the space $Y = (0,1) \times (0,1) \cup (1,2) \times (0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we can visualize the separation of $Y$ as
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
        \draw[dashed] (0,0) rectangle (2,1);
        \draw[dashed] (1,1)--(1,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Note that the dashed line is not in $Y$. Even though the dashed line contains limit points of both the left and right subset of $Y$, this does not matter. 
    \end{example}


    \begin{example}
    Let $X$ denote a two-point space in the indiscrete topology. Clearly, there is no separation of $X$, so $X$ is connected. 
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
    Let $Y$ denote the subspace $[-1,0) \cup (0,1]$ of $\mathbb{R}$. Each of the sets $[-1,0)$ and $(0,1]$ is nonempty and open in $Y$ (but not in $\mathbb{R}$), so they form a separation of $Y$. Also, note that neither of these sets contains a limit point of the other (even though they have a common limit point $0$). 
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
    $[-1,1]$, the subspace of $\mathbb{R}$, has no separation, so it is connected. 
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
    The rationals $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ are not connected since given any irrational number $a$, we can write $Y$ as the union of sets
    \[Y \cap (-\infty, a), \; Y \cap (a, +\infty)\]
    which are open in the subspace topology. 
    \end{example}

    \begin{lemma}
    If the sets $C$ and $D$ form a separation of $X$, and if $Y$ is a connected subset of $X$, then $Y$ lies entirely within either $C$ or $D$. 
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
    Trivial. Easy to visualize. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
    The union of a collection of connected sets that have a point in common is connected. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
        \draw[fill] (0,0) circle (0.05);
        \node[above right] at (0,0) {$p$};
        \draw (1,1) circle (1.8);
        \draw (-1,1.5) circle (2.5);
        \draw (-2, -0.5) circle (3);
        \draw (2,0) circle (3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \begin{proof}
    Let $\{A_\alpha\}$ be a collection of connected subsets of a space $X$, and let 
    \[p \in \bigcap A_\alpha\]
    Then, we claim that 
    \[Y \equiv \bigcup A_\alpha\]
    is connected. Assume $Y$ is not connected, that is, there exists $Y = C \cup D$ as a separation of $Y$. Then, $p \in C$ or $p \in D$. Without loss of generality, suppose $p \in C$. Since each $A_\alpha$ is connected, it must lie entirely within $C$ (by the previous lemma, since it contains the point $p \in C$) $\implies D = \emptyset$, a contradiction that $D$ must be nonempty. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
    Let $A$ be a connected subset of $X$. If $A \subset B \subset \bar{A}$, then $B$ is also connected. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Assume $B = C \cup D$ is a separation of $B \implies A$ must lie entirely within $C$ or $D$. Without loss of generality, suppose $A \subset C$, which implies that $\bar{A} \subset \bar{C}$. Since $\bar{C}$ and $D$ are disjoint, $B$ cannot intersect $D \implies D = \emptyset$, a contradiction. Therefore, there exists no separation of $B$. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
    The image of a connected space under a continuous map is connected. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a continuous map, and let $X$ be connected. We wish to prove that the image set $Z = f(X)$ is also connected. Let us denote the restriction of $f$ to $Z$ as
    \[\Tilde{f}: X \longrightarrow Z\]
    which is continuous and surjective. We prove by contradiction. Assume that $Z = A \cup B$ is a separation of $Z$ into 2 disjoint nonempty open sets. Then, $\Tilde{f}^{-1} (A)$ and $\Tilde{f}^{-1}(B)$ are disjoint open sets whose union is $X \implies \Tilde{f}^{-1} (A) \cup \Tilde{f}^{-1}(B)$ form a separation of $X$. This contradicts the hypothesis that $X$ is connected $\implies Z$ is connected.  
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
    Given connected topological spaces $X_\alpha$ with $\alpha \in J$, the Cartesian products of them is connected. That is, 
    \[\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha\]
    with the product topology is connected. If $J$ is infinite, then the product space is not necessarily connected under the box topology. 
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{definition}
    A simply ordered set $L$ having more than one element is called a \textbf{linear continuum} if the following hold. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $L$ has the least upper bound property. 
        \item If $x <y$, then there exists $z$ such that $x<z<y$
    \end{enumerate}
    A classic example of the linear continuum is the real number line and every set homeomorphic to it. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
    If $L$ is a linear continuum in the order topology, then $L$ is connected and so it every interval and ray in $L$. 
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{corollary}
    $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, along with every interval and ray in $\mathbb{R}$. 
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
    Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a continuous map of the connected space $X$ into the ordered set $Y$, with the order topology. Given $a, b \in X$ and $r \in Y$ such that $f(a)<r<f(b)$, then there exists a point $c \in X$ such that $f(c) = r$. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Assuming the hypothesis, the sets 
    \[A \equiv f(X) \cap (-\infty, r), \; B \equiv f(X) \cap (r, +\infty)\]
    are disjoint. They are also nonempty since 
    \[f(a) \in A, \; f(b) \in B\]
    $A$ and $B$ are open since they are the intersection of open sets. Now, assume that there exists no point $c \in X$ such that $f(c) = r$. Then, 
    \[f(X) = A \cup B\]
    would define a separation of $X$, contradicting the fact that the image of a connected space under a continuous map must be connected. Therefore, $c$ exists. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
    Given points $x$ and $y$ of the space $x$, a \textbf{path} in $X$ from $x$ to $y$ is a continuous map $f: [a,b] \longrightarrow X$ of some closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$ to $X$ such that $f(a) = x$ and $f(b)=y$. A space $X$ is said to be \textbf{path connected} if every pair of points of $X$ can be joined by a path in $X$. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
    $X$ is path connected $\implies X$ is connected. 
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
    $X$ not connected implies that there exists disjoint open subsets $C, D$ such that $C \cup D = X$. Assume that $X$ is path connected, i.e. there exists a continuous function $g: [0,1] \longrightarrow X$. Then the preimage of $C$ and $D$ in $X$ must be open sets $g^{-1} (C), g^{-1} (D) \subset [0,1]$ such that $g^{-1}(C) \cup g^{-1}(D) = [0,1]$. But this isn't possible since $[0,1]$ is connected, so by contradiction, $X$ is not path connected. The contrapositive of this statement results in the proposition. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
        \draw[dashed] (5,1) circle (2);
        \draw[dashed] (0,0) circle (2);
        \node at (-1,-1) {$C$};
        \node at (6,2) {$D$};
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(0,0) (2,1.5) (4.5,2)};
        \draw[fill] (0,0) circle (0.05);
        \draw[fill] (4.5,2) circle (0.05);
        \node at (-4,1) {$X = C \cup D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    However, note that $X$ connected $\centernot\implies$ $X$ path connected. Note the following example. 

    \begin{example}
    \[ f:[0,1] \longrightarrow [-1,1], \; f(x) = \sin{\frac{1}{x}}\]
    $[-1,1]$ is connected, but not path connected since the path oscillates infinitely many times as it approaches $0$ from both $-1$ and $1$. 
    \end{example}

    The concept of homotopies is dealt with in algebraic topology, but it is worthwhile to mention it now. 

    \begin{definition}
    Two continuous paths from $x$ to $y$ in topological space $X$ is \textbf{homotopic} if one can be continuously "deformed" into the other, such a deformation being the \textbf{homotopy} between two functions. The set of linearly homotopic paths form a relation, and thus \textbf{homotopy classes} can be further defined. 
    \end{definition}

    Visually, the set of all the curves in the space $X$ as shown are in a single homotopy class.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
        \draw (0,0) ellipse (5 and 2);
        \draw[fill] (-4,0) circle (0.05);
        \draw[fill] (4,0) circle (0.05);
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-1,1) (1,1) (4,0)};
        \draw (-4,0)--(4,0);
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-1,0.5) (1,0.5) (4,0)};
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-1,-0.5) (1,-0.5) (4,0)};
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-1,-1) (1,-1) (4,0)};
        \node at (-2,1.3) {$X$};
        \node[left] at (-4,0) {$a$};
        \node[right] at (4,0) {$b$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    It is clear that the space $X$ consists of a single homotopy class of curves from $a$ to $b$. However, let us define the space $Y \equiv X \setminus C$ where $C$ is a circular region in $X$. Then, $Y$ has an infinite number of homotopy classes. We show two curves, that are in two different homotopy classes. 
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
        \draw (0,0) ellipse (5 and 2);
        \draw[fill] (-4,0) circle (0.05);
        \draw[fill] (4,0) circle (0.05);
        \draw plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-1,1) (1,1) (4,0)};
        \node[left] at (-4,0) {$a$};
        \node[right] at (4,0) {$b$};
        \draw (0,0) circle (1);
        \node at (-2,1.3) {$Y$};
        \draw[blue] plot [smooth] coordinates {(-4,0) (-2,0.5) (-1,1) (1,1) (1,-1) (-1,-1) (-1,1) (1,1) (2,0.5) (4,0)};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \begin{definition}
    A \textbf{simply connected set} is a set such that all paths between any two given points are homotopic. That is, a simply connected set has one homotopy class. 
    \end{definition}

  \subsection{Components and Path Components}

    \begin{definition}
    Given $X$, define an equivalance relation on $X$ by setting $x \sim y$ if there is a connected subset of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The equivalence classes are called the \textbf{components}, or \textbf{connected components}, of $X$. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
    The components of $X$ are connected disjoint subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$, such that each connected subset of $X$ intersects only one of them. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Trivial. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
    We can define another equivalence relation on the space $X$ by defining $x \sim y$ if there is a path in $X$ from $x$ to $y$. The equivalence classes are called the \textbf{path components} of $X$. It can be easily shown that this is an equivalence relation. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
    The path components of $X$ are path connected disjoint subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$, such that each path connected subset of $X$ intersects only one of them. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Trivial.
    \end{proof}

    The property of local connectedness is also important for a space to possess. Roughly speaking, local connectivity means that each point has "arbitrarily small" neighborhoods that are connected. 

    \begin{definition}
    A space $X$ is said to be \textbf{locally connected at $x$} if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a connected open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ contained in $U$. If $X$ is locally connected at all of its points, then $X$ is simply said to be \textbf{locally connected}. 
    \end{definition}
    Visually, in the space $X$, let $U$ be the union of the two open balls shown below. $U$ is clearly open, but not necessarily connected. However, we can form a  neighborhood $V$ of $x$ contained in $U$ such that $V$ is connected. 
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
        \draw[fill] (-2,0) circle (0.05);
        \node[above] at (-2,0) {$x$};
        \draw[dashed] (-1.5,0) circle (3);
        \draw[dashed] (3,0) circle (1);
        \draw[dashed, fill=lightgray] (-2.5,0) circle (1.5);
        \node[left] at (-1.2,0) {$V$ connected};
        \node[right] at (-0.8,0) {$U$ not};
        \node[right] at (-0.8,-0.5) {connected};
        \node at (3,2) {$X$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Equivalently, $X$ is locally connected if there exists a basis for $X$ consisting of connected sets. Local connectedness and connectedness of a space are independent of each other. 

    \begin{definition}
    A space $X$ is \textbf{locally path connected at $x$} if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a path connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$ completely contained in $U$. If $X$ is locally path connected at each of its points, then it is simply said to be \textbf{locally path connected}. We can visualize this condition similarly as that of local connectedness. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
    A space $X$ is locally connected if and only if for every open set $U$ of $X$, each component of $U$ is open in $X$. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    $(\rightarrow)$ Suppose that $X$ is locally connected. Let $U$ be an open set of $X$ and let $C$ be a component of $U$. If $x$ is any point in $C$, by definition of local connectedness, there exists a connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$ fully contained in $U$. Since $V$ is connected, it must additionally lie completely within $C \implies C$ is open in $X$. \\
    $(\leftarrow)$ Suppose that the components of open sets in $X$ are open. Given a point $x \in X$ and neighborhood $U$ of $x$, let $C$ be the component of $U$ containing $x$, which means that $C$ is connected. By hypothesis, the components of open sets are alsvo open, so $C$ is also open. Since an open, connected set $C$ exists for all $x \in X$, $X$ is locally connected. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
    A space $X$ is locally path connected if and only if for every open set $U$ of $X$, each path component of $U$ is open in $X$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is a topological space, each path component of $X$ lies in a component of $X$. If $X$ is locally path connected, then the components and the path components of $X$ are the same. 
    \end{theorem}

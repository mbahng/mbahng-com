\section{Functions and Continuity} 

  Note that from set theory, we can construct functions as a subset of Cartesian product of two spaces $X, Y$. There is nothing new here. 

  \begin{definition}[Continuous Function]
    A function $f$ between 2 topological spaces $(X, \T_{X})$ and $(Y, \T_{Y})$ is \textbf{continuous at $x \in X$} if the preimage of every open neighborhood of $f(x) \in Y$ is an open neighborhood of $x \in X$.
    \begin{equation}
      U_{f(x)} \in \T_{Y} \implies x \in f^{-1}(U_{f(x)}) \in \T_{X}
    \end{equation} 
    $f$ is said to be \textbf{continuous} (at all points) if the preimage of every open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$.\footnote{Note that continuity of a function $f$ is not only determined by the function itself, but also by the topologies of $X$ and $Y$.}
  \end{definition}

  Note that it is easier for $f$ to be continuous when the $\T_X$ is finer (since there are more open sets in $X$ for the preimage of $V \subset Y$ to map to) or $\T_Y$ is coarser (since there are fewer open sets that we have to check to map to open sets of $X$). 

  \begin{theorem}[Sufficient Properties for Continuity]
    Let $X, Y$, be topological spaces and let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$. Then, the following are equivalent to $f$ being continuous. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The preimage of every basis element $B \in \T_Y$ is open in $X$. 
      \item For every closed set $B$ in $Y$, the set $f^{-1} (B)$ is closed in $X$. 
      \item For every subset $A$ of $X$, $f(\bar{A}) \subset \bar{f(A)}$. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}  
  \begin{proof}
    Listed. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item An arbitrary open set $V$ of $Y$ can be written as $V = \cup_{\alpha \in J} b_\alpha$. Then, 
      \begin{equation}
        f^{-1} (V) = f^{-1} \Big( \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} b_\alpha \Big) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} f^{-1} (b_\alpha)
      \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}

  Great, so we have a few ways in which we can check continuity of a function. There are a few special cases. 

  \begin{lemma}[Trivially Continuous Functions]
    We have the following for general topological spaces. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The identity function $\id: (X, \T_1) \rightarrow (X, \T_2)$ is continuous if $\T_1 \supset \T_2$. 
      \item A constant function $f: (X, \T) \rightarrow (Y, \T_2)$ is always continuous, regardless of the topologies. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    If we take an open set $U \in \T_2$, its preimage is the same set $U$, which is guaranteed to be in $\T_1$ since $\T_1$ is finer than $\T_2$. 
  \end{proof}

\subsection{Construction of Continuous Functions} 

  \begin{theorem}[Arithmetic on Real Continuous Functions]
    If $X$ is a topological space, and if $f, g: X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous, then $f + g$, $f-g$, and $f \cdot g$ are also continuous. $f / g$ is continuous if $g(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in X$. 
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{theorem}[Analytic Continuity = Topological Continuity] 
    Given metric spaces with their induced metric topologies $(X, \T_X, d_X)$ and $(Y, \T_Y, d_Y)$. The following are equivalent. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at $x$. 
      \item For every $\delta > 0$, there exists an $\epsilon = \epsilon(\delta) > 0$ such that for all $z \in X$, $d_X (x, z) < \epsilon \implies d_Y (f(x), f(x)) < \delta$.\footnote{This is the definition of continuity at a point in analysis.} 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    ($\rightarrow$) Assume $f$ is continuous according to the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition. Let $U$ be any open set in $Y$ containing the point $y$, and let $x$ be an element in $f^{-1}(U)$ such that $y = f(x)$. We must prove that $f^{-1}(U)$ is also open. Since open sets contain neighborhoods (e.g. open balls) of all of its points, we can claim that, since $U$ is open by assumption, there exists an open ball $B_y$ around $y$ with radius $\epsilon > 0$. This guarantees the existence of a point $z \in U$ such that $\rho(y, z) < \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ that we choose. Since $f$ is continuous, for every $\epsilon >0$ that we chose previously, there exists a $\delta >0$ such that $d(x, w) \implies \rho(f(x), f(w)) < \epsilon$. Since $\rho(f(x), f(w)) < \epsilon$, we can conclude that $f(w) \in B_y \subset U$ when $d(x, w) < \delta$. Therefore, $d(x, w) < \delta \implies w \in f^{-1}(U)$. But this is equivalent to saying that if $w \in B_(x, \delta)$, then $w \in f^{-1}(U)$, which means that every single point $x \in f^{-1}(U)$ contains an open ball neighborhood fully contained in $f^{-1}(U)$. So, by definition, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. 


    ($\leftarrow$) Assume $f^{-1}(U)$ is open when $U$ is an open set in $Y$, i.e. $f$ is continuous under the topological definition. Let us define the open ball 
    \[ B(f(x), \epsilon) \equiv \{ y \in Y \; | \; \rho(f(x), y) < \epsilon\} \in \tau_Y\]
    By our assumption, $f^{-1} \big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big)$ is an open set in $\tau_X$, and clearly, $x \in f^{-1} \big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big)$ since $f^{-1}$ maps the point $f(x) \in B(f(x), \epsilon)$ to $x \in f^{-1} \big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big)$. But since $f^{-1} \big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big)$ is open, we can construct an open ball around $x$ with radius $\delta$ fully contained within the open set. Moreover, by selecting a point $p \in B(f(x), \delta) \subset f^{-1}\big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big)$, we can guarantee that $f(p) \in B(f(x), \epsilon)$. This is precisely the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of continuity. That is, given an $\epsilon > 0$ to be the radius of an open ball $B(f(x), \epsilon)$ in $Y$, we can always choose a $\delta > 0$ to be the radius of the open ball $B(x, \delta)$ in $X$ that is fully contained within the preimage of $B(f(x), \epsilon)$. In mathematical notation, 
    \[ p \in B(x, \delta) \subset f^{-1} \big( B(f(x), \epsilon) \big) \implies f(p) \in f\big( B(x, \delta) \big) \subset B(f(x), \epsilon)\]
    or equivalently in terms of metrics,
    \[ d(x, p) < \delta \implies \rho (f(x), f(p)) < \epsilon\]
  \end{proof} 

\subsection{Sequences}

  \begin{definition}[Sequence]
    A sequence $(x_\alpha)$ of points in topological space $(X, \T)$ is said to \textbf{converge} to the point $x \in X$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      x_n \in U \text{ for all } n \geq N
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}

\subsection{Homeomorphisms}

  \begin{definition}[Homeomorphism]
    A bijective, bicontinuous function $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ between two topological spaces is called a \textbf{homeomorphism} between $X$ and $Y$. If there exists at least one homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$, then $X$ is said to be \textbf{homeomorphic} to $Y$, denoted $X \cong Y$. 

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering 
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/Homeomorphism_of_Plane.png}
      \caption{The visual below shows a homeomorphism between the plane $X$ and the surface $Y$.}
      \label{fig:homeomorphism_plane}
    \end{figure}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{theorem}[Sufficient Properties of Homeomorphism]
    Suppose $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a bijection. TFAE. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $U \subset Y$ is open iff $f^{-1} (U)$ is open. 
      \item $U \subset X$ is open iff $f(U)$ is open. 
      \item $f$ is a homeomorphism. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem} 

  \begin{example}[Comparability and Homeomorphic Spaces]
    Consider the set $X = \{a, b\}$ with the two topologies $\T_3 = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, X\}$ and $\T_4 = \{\emptyset, \{b\}, X\}$. They are not comparable but they seem ``similar'' in a way in that if we swap all the $a$'s and $b$'s in $\T_3$, then we get $\T_4$. We can make this rigorous by defining $f: (X, \T_3) \rightarrow (X, \T_4)$ with $f(a) = b, f(b) = a$, and showing that it is a homeomorphism. 
  \end{example}

  In fact, a homeomorphism $f$ is an equivalence relation between two topological spaces. This partitions the set of all topological spaces into \textbf{homeomorphism classes}. Analogous to how isomorphisms preserve algebraic structures, homeomorphisms preserve topological structure between topological spaces. 

  \begin{example}[Homeomorphism Classes of 2D Manifolds]
    There is an infinite family of 2-dimensional manifolds, call them $M$ and $N$, and each set in each family is not homeomorphic to another.  
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $M_0 = S^2$ (sphere). $M_1 = T^2$ (torus). $M_2$ is a donut with two holes. $M_3$ has three holes, and so on. 
      \item $N_1$ is the Mobius strip. $N_2$ is the Klein bottle. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}

  Additionally, not only does a homeomorphism give a bijective correspondence between points in $X$ and $Y$, but it also determines a bijection between \textbf{the set of all open sets in $X$ and $Y$} (that is, a bijection between their topologies)! This bijection then allows two spaces that are homeormophic to have the same topological properties. 

  \begin{theorem}[Preservation of Topological Properties]
    A homeomorphism $f$ between two topological spaces $(X, \tau_{x})$ and $(Y, \tau_{Y})$ preserves all topological properties (e.g. separability, countability, compactness, (path) connectedness) of $X$ onto $Y$ and $Y$ onto $X$. 
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{definition}[Embedding]
    Suppose that $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ an injective continuous map with $X, Y$ topological spaces. Let $Z \equiv \im{f}$. Then, the function
    \begin{equation}
      f^\prime: X \longrightarrow Z \subset Y
    \end{equation}
    obtained by restricting the codomain of $f$ is bijective. If $f^\prime$ happens to be a homeomorphism of $X$ with $Z$, then we say that the map
    \begin{equation}
      f: X \longrightarrow Y
    \end{equation}
    is a \textbf{topological embedding}, or more simply an \textbf{embedding}, of $X$ in $Y$. 
  \end{definition}

An overview of probability using measures. We will denote probability measures defined over $\sigma$-algebras with $\mathbb{P}$ and probability functions defined over some sample space $\Omega$ or $\mathbb{R}$ with $P$ or $p$. When we say countable, we mean finite or countably infinite. I have used resources from: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Rick Durret's \textit{Elementary Probability} and \textit{Probability} textbooks. 
  \item Dr. Krishna's \textit{Probability Foundation for Electrical Engineers} lectures at IIT. 
  \item Various quant interview books and websites for examples. 
\end{enumerate}

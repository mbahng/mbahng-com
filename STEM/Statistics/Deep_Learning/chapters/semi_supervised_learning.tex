\section{Semi Supervised Learning} 

  There has been good stream of work done at Google Brain that first came up with MixMatch in 2019 \cite{berthelot2019mixmatch}, which combined the state of the art semi supervised methods. This model was then improved the next year with ReMixMatch \cite{berthelot2020remixmatch}, and then improved again with a much more simple model called FixMatch \cite{sohn2020fixmatch}. 

  \subsection{Pseudo Label Learning} 
    
    Generating psuedo labels on unlabeled datasets and training on them. 

  \subsection{Consistency Regularization}
    
    Ensuring that the model is consistent with its predictions on certain inputs and neighbors of the inputs. It relies on the assumption that perturbed versions of the same input should have the same output. When wanting to make sure that the outputs are consistent with augmentations of the input, this is called \textbf{augmentation anchoring}. There are ways in which we use a combination of \textbf{weak augmentation} and \textbf{strong augmentation} to achieve this.

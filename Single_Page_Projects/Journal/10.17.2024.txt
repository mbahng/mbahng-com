Just came back from New York spending time with Pa and his friends. The trip hasn't been the most relaxing (especially the flight back when I only slept 2 hours) like how I intended but it was extremely fun. Playing smash until 3am, going clubbing at Mission, and grabbing good meals with friends. I appreciated how Bo gave me his Pokemon cards as a farewell gift and Ja bought us handmade cheesecake. 

The meeting with Gr didn't go too well, especially since she was seeing someone so I couldn't really do much for Pa (though he did talk to a girl in a club lol). I was talking about this to Sara on how she seemed a little cold, but she said that Gr was pretty representative of all girls and their thought process, leading me to question some of my biases. Here's a relatable scenario. You have friend A, who hears something bad about B. You therefore do not like B, though B has done nothing wrong to you. I personally don't feel as strongly towards B as most people, so what is the correct way to view B? For example, there are people who liked and hated me for these reasons, so it's personally very relevant to me. 

Here's my model. 
1. Let the set of all people in the world be $X$. 
2. For every $x, y \in X$, let $P_{x, y}$ be a continuous scalar probability distribution. This represents the total amount of utility that $x$ will receive from $y$. What is this utility? It can be in terms of career gains, happiness, etc. (and can be negative). So if this random variable realizes to say $+2$, you have gained $2$ utility from knowing this person and spending time with them. If it realizes to $-1$, you have lost utility and this person had a negative impact on your life. This is a distribution since life is random, so even if you knew exactly what the person is like, it doesn't determine for certainty whether they will have a positive or negative impact on you. 
3. Everybody starts off with a prior distribution on their impression of someone before any knowledge. If you ($x$) met a random person $y$ you have never seen or heard of before, then your impression is $P_{x, y}^0$. This is your prior distribution, which should be the same for everybody and should model the distribution of utility you will get from this person. There is indeed a true distribution, but you don't know it yet. Maybe this can be a slightly positive mean Gaussian, since most people you meet in your life tends to have at least a slightly positive impact. The mean is most likely not negative since this means that you are best off not interacting with anyone for the rest of your life, which is absurd. 
4. Now say that you heard something about $y$, e.g. $y$ is very smart. This corresponds to a sample point, say $+1$, and you can make a posterior distribution $P_{x, y}^1$ which pushes your mean slightly higher. A negative sample will correspond to lowering the mean as well. From hearing various things about someone, you gain sample points which update your posterior. 
5. Now when you decide to meet someone, you must compare the expected utility you get against the effort $T_{x, y}$ you exert to meet this person. If $E[P_{x, y}] > T_{x, y}$, you should meet them. If not then you shouldn't. 

This is generally my theory for choosing when to meet someone. Consider the following cases. 
1. You're meeting with friends and a guy sits next to you. $T_{x, y}$ is quite low since you he's already there ready to talk. If you heard a mix of good and bad things about him, but E[P_{x, y}] > 0, then you should probably talk to him since the potential gain from talking is greater than the little effort you exert to talk. 
2. If you hear very negative things about someone, $E[P_{x, y}] < 0$, so you shouldn't talk to him. In fact, if he tries to talk to you, you should exert effort to not talk to him, up until the point where you think the loss of talking to him is less than the force you exert in not talking. This happens if you're a girl at a club and a guy comes up to you in the middle of the night asking you for your number. You don't want to give him your number, but if you reject and he keeps pushing, you are going to exert more effort than if you just gave him your number, walked away, and blocked him (still net negative but not as much so). 
3. If you want to meet Elon Musk, $E[P_{x, y}]$ can be very great. Even three months of work, corresponding to $T_{x, y}$, may be warranted since $E[P_{x, y}]$ is still greater. He can make decisions that can personally change your life for the better. 

Now everybody has a different rate of change $\lambda$. We can think of this as a multiplicative factor in which a sample affects their impression of someone. Say someone had a low $\lambda = 0.1$. Then, if they heard positive things about someone, then their probability distribution will nudge forward, but not that much. If they had a high $\lambda = 10$, then 1 sample will be equivalent to $10$, and their distribution will leap to a very positive value. This depends on the person. I personally tend to have a small $\lambda$.

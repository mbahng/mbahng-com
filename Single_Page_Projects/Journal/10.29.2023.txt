Well back to waking up at 2pm, though I did have a pretty late night at the Halloween party
yesterday. I met a lot of people, arm wrestled a bunch lmao, and had a good time. 

Anyways, I've been reflecting on which professors would be the best advisor for me. I need to judge
them based on
  1) Their availability. 
  2) Their prestige and how knowledgeable they are. 
  3) The relevance of their research to my own interests. 
  4) Which journals and type of research they publish in (e.g. more theoretical, methods based, or
     application?)
     
Well to summarize, I first want to study as much math as I can: measure theory, differential
geometry, etc. They probably won't be very useful in applied research but I just want to learn them.
Second, I want to be really good at physics, learning all the abstract stuff as well. Then, I want
to have extreme control over my own computer, learning all the basics about operating systems,
drivers, and hopefully can set up Arch Linux. Finally, I want to use this to conduct great research. 

On the physcis side, I have Kotwal on the particle physics and perhaps can contact some mutual
professors for quantum computing. In machine learning, there's Vahid Tarokh, Lawrence Carin, David
Dunson, Cynthia Rudin, and Guillermo Sapiro. I should probably choose one of these professors to
work under, and then either Kotwal for physics or another ML professor. The other ML professor might
be the Texas A&M professor that Young's going to introduce me to. We'll see how that goes.

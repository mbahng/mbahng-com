Today will be short. I did a short but nice interview with AllianceBernstein. The guy that I talked
so was pretty friendly and asked me a nice combinations of behavioral and techincal questions. After
that I just gridned on the Jane Street interview tomorrow, but in all honesty it's not something I'm
very interested in. I'll just chill on this one. 

I also met Ivan actually today since he was here to visit Duke. It did seem a little odd that he was
visiting Duke, and he actually told me that it was to visit his boyfriend. I'm glad that he trusts
me enough to come out to me that he is bisexual. It did seem that we had a little barrier in between
us, so it's good progress. He was also curious about my startup idea, which was pretty funny. I
think I should start on it soon.

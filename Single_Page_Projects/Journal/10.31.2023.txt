Today I've done the JS interview, which went pretty terribly, mainly because I wasn't really in the
interview mode. Interestingly, it turns out that my interviewer was the Graham White, the guy that
was on the Jane Street mock interview on Youtube. He apparently did a math PhD in probability and
stochastic processes, which was cool. However, he gave me way too many hints for me to have passed.

I then talked with Prof. Kotwal and were discussing on starting the C++ implementation of the
wedgeCover code. I'm excited to start the C++, but I also have to start learning Flutter as well. 

Sara also messaged me today about some scheduling conflicts with John since he was going to be back
in Portland when I visited. His birthday is then, so she said that she might have to spend some time
alone with him, which is unfair to me since she's been asking me to prioritize her, but oh well. It
really isn't but what can I do.

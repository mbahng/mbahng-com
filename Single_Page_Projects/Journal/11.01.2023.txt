After my interview with Jane Street, I feel a good amount of weight off my back. Surprisingly they
haven't rejected me yet, so I'm wondering what's taking them so long. I'm also curious on my
interviewer White's background and why he decided to go into finance after a math PhD. 

Anyways, I've been focusing on trying to master Vim. I've set up some of the custom keybindings for
making new windows, navigating through them, and resizing them. It's getting pretty fun to be honest
and Vim isn't a complete pain to use anymore (still is tho). I still have Flutter and C++ to work
on so I better master this quickly. 

I wonder how Sara's doing, since we haven't called in like 2 days. I hope she doesn't feel guilty
about the whole abandoning me for John. I'm really okay with it, but I'm not sure if she can see
that. I'll give her a call tonight. 

Yesterday on Halloween, Leon also came over talking about this Maya girl that he was in love with.
To be honest (and I told this to him), I didn't think it would work out but he's quite passionate on
pursuing her ha. Sometimes he seems like too much of a child, and I can't tell him that I'm not the
only one who also thinks that. Once he realizes that, I think his female friends will seem him as a
guy lol.

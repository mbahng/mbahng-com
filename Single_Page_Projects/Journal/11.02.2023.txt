Okay today we'll keep it short. I felt pretty down from the fact that I am always waking up super late, going to bed super late, and not getting any progress done on my homework. It's mainly because I'm feeling a bit unmotivated and also I'm trying to transition into Vim. I've tried to wrap my mind around support vector machines for like 5 hours now, and it's still not intuitively coming to me. 

I was happy that PK invited to drink with me. I ended up playing a shitton of overwatch myself, and then with Sara (which was quite fun), and then joined my roommates for drinks at 3am. We ended up drinking until 9am lmao.

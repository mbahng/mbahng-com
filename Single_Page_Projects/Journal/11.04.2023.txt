Today's the second day of the hackathon, and so far this has been a great way to distract me from the depressing fact that I have a terrible sleep schedule. Even now I'm writing this at 3am bruh. We met up later in the afternoon, and I worked a little bit before we met up. Essentially today was a debugging day, and we mainly worked at the smarthome. For some reason, the other guys (Liam, Emily, Pauline, and two other guys) started drinking and so once I mostly finished debugging, I joined. 

I ended up drinking too much wine. I remember up until like 3:30am, where Pauline and I arm wrestled, the other peeps talked about their exes, we had some debates, Liam and Emily started wrestling, and other shit happened. Apparently after asking Liam, he told me I ended up throwing up in his bathroom in the toilet (Ezra woke up and was like "damn Liam are you okay?"). Then Liam took us back in his car, and while the other guys were in the car, I apparently put my hand on his shoulder, looked him dead in the eyes, and after a dramatic pause, told him "hey Liam, this is what I used to do back in parties in Korea," and proceeded to vomit LMAOOO. tbh the funniest shit I did that night, and I'm not surprised I did that. After that Pauline and one of the guys took me back to my room, and the next day I woke up refreshed. In fact, I was so refreshed I concluded that I must have thrown up the previous night. After that I took the most black-waterfall shit I have ever taken. It was almost scary how much wine was coming out of my ass.

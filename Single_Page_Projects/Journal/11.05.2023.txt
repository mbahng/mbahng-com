This Sunday marked the end of the Hackathon, and we just ended up patching everything together. We didn't really care about the registration and ended up missing the whole concluding presentation fair but eh who gives a shit. I've learned how to use flutter and implement a (crappy) ML backend. I had a github repo and was happy with it.

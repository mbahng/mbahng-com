Today I skipped class as usual, had a meeting with Ying. Nothing too out of the ordinary. 

Now for some reason (I think I saw it in a video), I had a weird desire to install Arch today. I didn't care, but today was going to be the day that I start using Arch. I had failed about two months ago since I was stuck in the network configuration mode, but I saw this new shortcut with an ArchInstall script that automates the process but gives us the flexibility to choose what packages we want to install. So after a long night of pain and struggle (I ended up documenting every step for future use), I finally installed it on a triple boot machine. I was so excited to start using Arch, half because I want to configure my computer from the ground up and half because I can now tell people I use Arch LOL. I want to know why this is such a flex ha. Not only that, I decided to use a tiling windows manager (I found out about WMs like two days ago) and give it a try, since most of my workflow is in tiles anyways (esp with vscode or latex). Turns out: best decision of my life. After that I had the pleasure of downloading the other regular apps I use.

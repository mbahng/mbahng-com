Today, I just spent the entire day grinding on the machine learning 671 homework, which I was able to finish thanks to Alex Kato. After 10pm, my back had hurt so much (from sitting so much pulling all nighters in the hackathon and from setting up Arch) that I immediately went to the gym, did some back, and relaxed the rest of the night.

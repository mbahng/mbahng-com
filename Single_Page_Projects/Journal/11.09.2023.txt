Okay, now today was time to grid for the deep learning homework. I just worked with Kato in Wilkinson for the entire day, meeting at 1pm and working until like 12am. Having been already at Wilkinson, we also trained on the i3t servers lmao since it was like 5 times faster. Overall, I didn't have too much of a clue, but he seemed to be getting it and also carried me. To be honest, I don't know why but I lost motivation to do any of the homework, and it sort of scared me. I'm not sure if this was due to my questioning of what I should do in life, or because I was too burnt out from installing Arch, or something else. 

Also when we had lunch together, Kato talked to me about his hunting stuff, which was pretty cool. I also got him a free cookie from il forno. 

Anyways we got #1 and #3 done, I went back and called Nathan Ngyuen to talk about those, got the answers for #2, and was done for the day.

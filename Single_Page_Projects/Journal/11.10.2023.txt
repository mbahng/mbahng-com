Now I worked all day with Kato, where he managed to get his work in on time. Unfortunately there were bugs in his code in my homework, and we couldn't debug it in time (since Leon came to Hollows at 10pm and was waiting like 1.5 hours for me). I just decided to take the late 10% off. Kato was pretty scared and adamant about me changing up my work a lot before I submitted, and I was a little annoyed that he didn't trust me, but I also get where he's coming from: he didn't do so well on his RPN homework and isn't sure what his grades are going to be, along with bombing his first midterm. Also he carried my ass through this homework, so I shouldn't be complaining. Respecting him and taking the L myself is more important than getting a bit more points, which may even be covered with the extra credit.

Then Leon and I started drinking. He made some ramen and me some teokbokki. We then went out and met Alina and her friend and started drinking. Went until 6am and Leon slept over.

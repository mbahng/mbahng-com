Leon and I woke up at 3pm, got lunch at tandoor. Then we just went on our own ways, I tried configuring and organizing by making a `~/dotfile` repo and uploading it to github, along with starting to use Neovim rather than Vim (the pushing factor was that Neovim has telescope, though I still use Vim for stuff like vimwiki).

Today I starting ricing up my picom and qtile. It was a lot of testing and shit but overall was fun. 

Han then picked me up to eat at Mediterra with his old friend Jackie, who was a master's student at UBC doing some quantum computing stuff. That was cool, and Jackie ended up givig me his business card and told me to email him.

Today there was a big annoying bug where the shared ram (according to my htop) starts going up without bounds as soon as I open slightly memory consuming apps (like too many terminal windows or firefox or zoom). idk why this happened so suddenly, but I noticed it filling up my 16GB of RAM, then my 8GB of swap, and then my computer freezing and crashing. This happened like 30 minutes before my final interview round with Akuna, and I didn't think I could debug this in time, so I dual booted into windows, installed Zoom on there, signed in, and just did the interview there. 

The interview went well. I'm so glad I messaged him the past weekend to ask rather than thinking I could wing it or smth.

After that, Liam dropped by to give me my water bottle. We went over to WU to grab a bite, met Martin and got his instagram, met Pauline, and went to shome to study. After a few hours, at 8:30pm we went out to get Chinese food at Happy China. Zach (Emily's friend and the guy who teaches the classes on Mondays) ended up breaking something in the basement and felt really sorry for delaying us, since Happy China was going to stop taking dine ins at 9pm. He was really nice though, and it was fine.

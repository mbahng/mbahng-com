    (2023-04-26) I am finally done with classes, it's LDOC today at Duke. But for some reason, I can't shake the feeling that I haven't learned thoroughly enough this semester. Perhaps I place too high of an expectation on myself, comparing my own knowledge with the immense experience of my professors, and I think I need to work on pacing myself rather than trying to catch up to them. 
    <br>
    This reminds me of my experience back in Korea, when I had self-studied topics like analysis to be more familiar with them. However, in my classes, I find my lack of mastery biting back at me constantly whenever analysis is mentioned. My hand isn't held anymore, and the pace at which they cover concepts, leading me to question whether I should have just focused on mastering a few topics deeply rather than getting a broad exposure to multiple ones.

    I was never really a ``history guy,'' and it was really this semester that I've learned a significant amount about both Korean and world history, both in this class and my Korean class. I think one can learn a good deal on the dynamics of human nature in its best and worst lights. If you really think about it, the way in which human society tends to bisect into two political or social extremes (democracy vs communist on the global scale, or liberal vs conservative in the United States) that villanize each other isn't something that you would expect. I personally find it more natural that most people take a neutral stance, with some outliers here and there, but this is not what we see in the Cold War. Perhaps the tendency to stratify ourselves is a part of human nature, but there have been notable efforts to bridge these gaps. For example, I was extremely touched by the acts of empathy that I saw in movie directors (Park Chan-Wook's depiction of North Koreans as humans like us in <i>JSA</i>), civillians (Yang's family's love across the border in <i>Dear Pyongyang</i>), and individual Americans (several interviews of soldiers whistleblowing on racist indicents towards Blacks and the Vietnamese from the Rubenstein archives). Rather than trying to argue on a specific stance, as Heonik Kwon states in <i>The Other Cold War</i>, I want to try and "imagine alternative trajectories and horizons of comparison" beyond the civilization that we see today. (Kwon, 45)

    Let's compare the global powers between the time periods up to the 20th century and currently. First, we should settle that different nations had different political beliefs. Most major national governments must have thought - very stubbornly - that their own system was the best, namely the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Other smaller nations may have also held this belief, but they did not have the economic and military power to enforce onto others. In the U.S.'s perspective, even if their homeland is not directly threatened, attacks or reforms on smaller democratic countries is a threat to the permeation of their belief, and thus they have motiviation to stop this. In short, as the South Korean general in <i>JSA</i> states, there are only "commies and enemies of commies," and everybody who does not follow democracy is an enemy of the nation.

    I am assuming that the U.S. cares about two things: their homeland and their beliefs, and this seems to explain their selfish actions in both Korea and Vietnam during the Cold War. When another superpower like the Soviet threatens to spread their system, the U.S. would naturally want to fight back not because they care about the foreign citizens, but rather because their first priority is to protect their political establishment. Why else would they establish more than 100 military bases just in Korea and hundreds more in other countries (Moon, 236)? Perhaps it is to protect the foreigners in good will? The evidence seem to say otherwise. If we take a look at the statistics of the two wars, we see that there were 3 million total Vietnamese casualties compared to about 50 thousand U.S. soldiers and just 16 Soviet soldiers. Same for the Korean war, with 1.3 million Korean casualties compared to 40 thousand U.S. GIs. One may think that this may have been because it was expensive to station U.S. soldiers due to geographical distance... but then why were there over 2.7 million total U.S. soldiers stationed in Vietnam? It clearly seems that the U.S. had the resources. This relative insignifance of Korea (and other "proxy" nations) are seen even today with the continued existence of these bases, where local troops such as KATUSAs were (and perhaps still are) considered more dispensible than American GIs.

    This blatant ethical breach did not go completely unnoticed. For example, the biggest anti-Vietnam War program was the Vietnam Summer led by Martin Luther King Jr., which gathered funds and volunteers to raise awareness of the devastation caused by the war. Even amongst soldiers, I read multiple accounts in the then-newspaper, <i>Vietnam GI</i>, where troops complained that the lower rank soldiers and locals that "take the orders and carry them out are the ones who get burned" while the U.S. sits back. There was even an account in the <i>Marine Interview</i> section of a veteran asserting that the U.S. should admit "like the French" they they made a mistake, as it "takes a pretty big person to say they were wrong." 
  </p>

    From this logic, we may conclude that there are two (not mutually exclusive) reasons for their assertion of military power. First, the locals were so insignificant that their deaths had no weight in the U.S.'s decision-making, which we've concluded is a serious ethical concern for a nation with such great power. The second reason is that perhaps a democracy is truly the best political system that we can have in the world (say that the U.S. had a msytical orb that told this great truth), and they want what is best for the world. Well with both the U.S. and Soviets on opposite spectrums, both democracy and communism cannot <i>both</i> be the best. So for sure one or both of their orbs are broken. Even if democracy is the true best system, was it really worth 4+ million casualties (just in the two countries alone)? Can we really compare the future prosperity that a best political system will bring us to past deaths and trauma? There's so many complex factors here at play that we cannot hope to quantify, even its effects on a single mother and her child.

      After watching <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> by Yang Yonghi, I was deeply touched from not only the storyline of the parents, but also on how it changed my own perception of Korea. I still attending middle school in America when Kim Jong Un was all over the news about constructing yet another suite of missiles to prepare for war. My friends, from a mixture of ignorance and humor, would jokingly ask if I was really North Korean, and to my surprise, they would be surprised (and a little bit scared) when I joined in on the humor and said yes. It is easy to ignore such a country as some "bad" place that you should never go, but I was a bit surprised after watching this movie on the lack of North Korean representation in the world. 

      There are a few that I have briefly seen. There are Korean movies of families being torn apart between the two Koreas during the Korean war, each waiting on their side of the border hoping for reunification. A more modern adaptation is the K-drama <i>Crash Landing on You</i>, which is a romantic and comedic story between a North Korean soldier and a South Korea woman. However, despite these shows that shed a bit more light on the fact that North Korea is not all about prisons or missiles, the dichotomy seems to get wider. The blow-up of South Korean bands like BTS and their growing presence in the global economy paints the country as a beacon of modernity and technology, while North Korea... is just North Korea. It had been the same as always.  

      <figure>

      So where did these views all come from? This has to with the West, mostly the United States', influence on East Asia and its "demonization of North Korea." (Ryang, 12). Especially after the second world war, the superiority of the U.S. was established, and as a consequence media had villanized all communist countries as an evil, disregarding the humanity of its citizens and portraying them as brainwashed prisoners. This worsens the reputation of said countries, which leads to greater tension, leading to even worse reputations. It seems to me like a vicious, self-fulfilling cycle. 

      <figure>
        <img src="miss.jpg" alt="Kim Jong Un with Missiles" class="centered-image">

      </figure>

      Clearly, there is more to this story. The most obvious message are the consequences of diaspora, modeled through a life of "insecurity and an ongoing crisis of identity" (Ryang, 2), which have been slowly permeating to broader audience through interviews with North Korean defectors, biographies, and movies. This can be seen when the father in <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> sends his sons to North Korea despite the "impoverished living conditions" and even "discrimination against returnees ... sent by earlier migrants." (Ogawa, 32) This film is a refreshing view that casts North Koreans in a more humanizing light, emphasizing familial loyalty and genuine hope. Furthermore, what seems like a low-quality film with shaky low-resultion camera shots contribute to the authenticity of the message, and it personally felt like I was watching an old video of my own family. Furthermore, it tells us the broad consequences of geopolitical tensions on countless lives. I recently learned a Korean proverb during a Korean language table, which says "고래 싸움에 새우 등 터진다," which translates directly to "If two whales fight, a shrimp's back will break." I think this perfectly describes the impact of cross-border conflicts on individual's lives. 

      Ultimately, watching <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> taught me to question these stereotypes surrounding a nation. Under the skin of media impressions resides a deep ocean of emotions, beliefs, and hopes, which I caught a glimpse of. I hope to see more about Korean representations from both sides, whether it'd be another documentary like this one or even more modern drama-like adaptations of North Korea like <i>Crash Landing on You</i>.

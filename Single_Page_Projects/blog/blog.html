      After watching <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> by Yang Yonghi, I was deeply touched from not only the storyline of the parents, but also on how it changed my own perception of Korea. I still attending middle school in America when Kim Jong Un was all over the news about constructing yet another suite of missiles to prepare for war. My friends, from a mixture of ignorance and humor, would jokingly ask if I was really North Korean, and to my surprise, they would be surprised (and a little bit scared) when I joined in on the humor and said yes. It is easy to ignore such a country as some "bad" place that you should never go, but I was a bit surprised after watching this movie on the lack of North Korean representation in the world. 

      There are a few that I have briefly seen. There are Korean movies of families being torn apart between the two Koreas during the Korean war, each waiting on their side of the border hoping for reunification. A more modern adaptation is the K-drama <i>Crash Landing on You</i>, which is a romantic and comedic story between a North Korean soldier and a South Korea woman. However, despite these shows that shed a bit more light on the fact that North Korea is not all about prisons or missiles, the dichotomy seems to get wider. The blow-up of South Korean bands like BTS and their growing presence in the global economy paints the country as a beacon of modernity and technology, while North Korea... is just North Korea. It had been the same as always.

      So where did these views all come from? This has to with the West, mostly the United States', influence on East Asia and its "demonization of North Korea." (Ryang, 12). Especially after the second world war, the superiority of the U.S. was established, and as a consequence media had villanized all communist countries as an evil, disregarding the humanity of its citizens and portraying them as brainwashed prisoners. This worsens the reputation of said countries, which leads to greater tension, leading to even worse reputations. It seems to me like a vicious, self-fulfilling cycle. 

      <figure>

      </figure>

      Clearly, there is more to this story. The most obvious message are the consequences of diaspora, modeled through a life of "insecurity and an ongoing crisis of identity" (Ryang, 2), which have been slowly permeating to broader audience through interviews with North Korean defectors, biographies, and movies. This can be seen when the father in <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> sends his sons to North Korea despite the "impoverished living conditions" and even "discrimination against returnees ... sent by earlier migrants." (Ogawa, 32) This film is a refreshing view that casts North Koreans in a more humanizing light, emphasizing familial loyalty and genuine hope. Furthermore, what seems like a low-quality film with shaky low-resultion camera shots contribute to the authenticity of the message, and it personally felt like I was watching an old video of my own family. Furthermore, it tells us the broad consequences of geopolitical tensions on countless lives. I recently learned a Korean proverb during a Korean language table, which says "고래 싸움에 새우 등 터진다," which translates directly to "If two whales fight, a shrimp's back will break." I think this perfectly describes the impact of cross-border conflicts on individual's lives. 

      Ultimately, watching <i>Dear Pyongyang</i> taught me to question these stereotypes surrounding a nation. Under the skin of media impressions resides a deep ocean of emotions, beliefs, and hopes, which I caught a glimpse of. I hope to see more about Korean representations from both sides, whether it'd be another documentary like this one or even more modern drama-like adaptations of North Korea like <i>Crash Landing on You</i>.
